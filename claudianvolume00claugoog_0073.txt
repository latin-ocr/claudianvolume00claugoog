THE FIRST BOOK AGAINST RUFINUS

left them, either wresting them from the living
owners or fastening upon them as an inheritor.
Massed riches are piled up and a single house
receives the plunder of a world ;· whole peoples
are forced into slavery‚ and thronging cities bow
beneath the tyranny of a private man.

Madman, what shall be the end? Though thou
possess either ocean, though Lydia pour forth for
thee her golden waters‚ though thou join Croesus’
throne to Cyrus' crown‚ yet shalt thou never be rich
nor ever contented with thy booty. The greedy
man is always poor. Fabricius, happy in his honour—
able poverty‚ despised the gifts of monarchs3 the
consul Serranus sweated at his heavy plough and a
small cottage gave shelter to the warlike Curii.
To my mind such poverty as this is richer than
thy wealth, such a home greater than thy palaceS.
There pernicious luxury seeks for the food that
satisfieth not3 here the earth provides a banquet
for which is nought to pay. With thee wool absorbs
the dyes of Tyre 3 thy patterned clothes are stained
with purple 3 here are bright flowers and the meadow's
breathing' charm which owes its varied hues but to
itself. There are beds piled on glittering bedsteads 3
here stretches the soft grasS, that breaks not sleep
with anxious cares. There a crowd of clients dins
through the spacious 113115, here is song of birds and
the murmur of the gliding stream. A frugal life is
best. Nature has given the opportunity of happi-
ness to all, knew they but how to use it. Had we
realized this we should now have been enjoying
a simple life, no trumpets would be sounding, no
whistling spear would speed, no ship be buffeted by
the wind, no siege-engine overthrow battlementS.
