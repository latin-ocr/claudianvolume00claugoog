has given his back freedom from the lash. '

Prosperity awaits our empire3 thy name is earnest
for the fulfilment of our hopes, The past guarantees
the future3 each time that thy sire made thee chief
magistrate of the year the laurels of victory crowned
his armS. Once the Gruthungi, hewing down a
forest to make them boatS, dared to pass beyond
the Danube. Three thousand vesseIS‚ each crowded
with a barbarous crew, made a dash across the river.
Odothaeus was their leader. Thy youth, nay, the
first year of thy life, crushed the attempt of that
formidable fleet. Its boats filled and sank; never
did the fish of that northern river feed more lavishly
on the bodies of men. The island of Peuce was
heaped high with corpses, Scarce even through
five mouths could the river rid itself of barbarian
blood, and thy sire, owning thine influence, gave
thanks to thee for the spoils won in person from
King Odothaeus, Consul a second time thou didst
end civil war by thine auspiceS. Let the world
thank thee for the overthrow of the Gruthungi and
the defeat of their king ; thou wast consul when the
Danube ran red with their blood, thou wast consul,
ton, when thy sire crossed the Alps to victory.²

But thou, once author of thy father's successeS,
shalt now be author of thine own. Triumph has ever
attended thy consulship and victory thy fasces,

dated as 886, the year of Honorius' first consulship (see
note on viii. ⁹153). yHonorius' second consulship (394p) saw
the defeat of EugeniuS.
