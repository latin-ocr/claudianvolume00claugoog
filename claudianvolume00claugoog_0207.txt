AGAINST EUTROPIUS, I

“ Ι would ‘not cite examples from remote anti-
quity nor count the countless magistrates of past
history whom he thus outrageS. But think how the
reverence due to all past ages will be impaired, on
how many centuries one man’s shame will set its
mark. Amid the annals that record the name of
Arinthaeus‚1 his master, will be found the slave,
and 116 will enter his own honours as equal to those
Α of his owner. The slaves of Egypt’s kings have
ever been a curse to the world3 behold I suffer
from a worse than Pothinus and bear a wrong more
flagrant than that of which Egypt was once the 366116.
Pothinus’ sword at Alexandria spilled the blood of a
single consul ; 2 ‘Eutropius brings dishonour on all.

“ If the fate of subj ects cannot move thee, yet
have thou regard for princeS, for your common cause,
and remove this stain on royalty. The consul-
ship is the sole office the emperor deigns to accept ;
alternately the honour passes to Court and Senate.
Thou who hast thyself been four times consul spare
succeeding consuls this infamy. Ι pray thee, protect
the fasceS, so often thine‚ from the pollution of a
eunuchsss hand 3 let not the omens handed down in
our sacred bookS‚ let not those robes of mine where-
with I have subdued everything within Ocean’s
stream, be plunged in so great darkness and trodden
under foot. What kind of wars 6311 we wage now
that a eunuch takes the auspices ? What marriage,
what harvest will be fruitful ἓ What fertility, what
abundance is possible beneath a consul stricken with
sterility ? If eunuchs shall give judgement and
determine laws, then let men card wool and live like
the AmazonS, confusion and licence dispossessing
the order of nature.
