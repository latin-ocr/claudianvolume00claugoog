AGAINST EUTROPIUS, I

this year of office, to ensure that by his efforts alone
he leaves nothing not dishonoured, ruining the army
as its general, the courts as their judge, the imperial
fasti as a consul, ’

No portent so monstrous but time past has given
it birth and the labour of bygone centuries produced
it. Legend tells us that Oedipus married his mother
and Thyestes his daughter3 Jocasta bare brothers
to her husband, Thyestes’s daughter gave birth to
her own brother. Athenian tragedy tells the sad

looked in amaze on the dogs that girt her waist.
Ancient story relates how one was transformed into
a tree and thus attached to earth, how another grew
wings and ssew, how a third was clothed with scales
and yet another melted into a river. But no country
has ever¹ had a eunuch for a consul or judge or general.
What in a man is honourable is disgraceful in an emas-p
culate. Here is an example to surpass all that is most
laughable in comedy, most lamentable in tragedy.

A pleasant sight in truth to see him strain his
sapless limbs beneath the weight of the toga, borne
