THE FOURTH CONSULSHIP OF HONORIUS

sought in vain for the stolen waterS, that, once
within our foemen’s reach, Stilicho had turned aside
in another course, and commanded the stream, that
marvelled at its strange channel amid unknown
wayS, to shift its altered track. '

What wonder that the nations barring thy path
should fall before thee, since the barbarian of his
own choice now seeks to serve thee Ρ The Sarmatae,
ever a prey to internal strife, beg to swear allegiance
to thee ; the Geloni cast off their cloaks of hide and

Ι 0 fight for thee; yon, O Alans, have adopted the

customs of Latium. As thou choosest for war men
that are brave and eager for the fray, so thou choosest
for the offices of peace men that are just, and once
chosen keepest them long in their charge, not
ousting them by ever new successorS. We know
the magistrates who govern uS, and we enjoy the
blessings of peace while we reap the advantages
of war, as though we lived at one and the same
time in the reign of warlike Romulus and peace-
loving Numa. A sword is no longer hung over
our heads3 there are no massacres of the great3
gone is the mob of false accusers3 no melancholy
exiles are driven from their fatherland. Unholy
increase of perpetual taxes is at‘an end ; there are
no accursed listS,l no auctions of plundered wealth 3
the voice of greed summons not the salesman, nor
is thy treasury increased by private losseS. Thou
art liberal with thy money, yet not wasteful of it.
The loyalty of thy soldiers is a lasting loyalty,
for it is not bought, nor is it gifts that win their love 3
the army is anxious for the success of its own child
and loves thee who wast its nursling.

And how deep is thy devotion to Rome herself!
