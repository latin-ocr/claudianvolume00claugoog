AGAINST EUTROPIUS‚ II

rumour—that Babylon is again in arms and, under a
new monareh‚ ¹ threatens our Empire3 the ParthianS,
lo'ng inactive, and now seorning slothful ease, seek
to put an end to the peace imposed by Rome.
Rare among the Medes 1s the murder of a king, for
punishment falls on the regieide' s whole family.
Thus equal obedienee is offered to their overlords‚
eruel as well as kind. But what would not the year
of Eutropius' consulship dare ? 'Tis that has stricken
down our faithful ally Sapor and roused the Per-
sians' swords against their own king 3 that has cast
the toreh of the Furies across the EuphrateS, there
to ‘kindle rebellion‚ that no quarter of the globe
ωᾩνὴὲῗιοῗῐξὲεἰῗίωηῖξὲ 5 hearts failed them, their cour-
age ebbed away amid all these storms; surrounded
as they were on every side by the din of war, at
last they recognized the wrath of heaven and their
eonsul' 5 evil omen, learning too late—schooled by
the stubborn issue—their now irrevocable doom.
They say that the twin sons of Iapetus formed our
first parents of the same materials but with une'qual
skill. Those whom Prometheus fashioned, and with
whose clay he mingled abundant ether, foresee
the distant future and, thanks to their more careful
making by a better workman, are thus prepared
to meet what fate has in store for them. Those
framed of baser clay by the sorry artifieer the Greek
poets so well eall EpimetheuS, men through whose
limbs no ethereal vigour spreads-these, like sheep,
cannot avoid the dangers that o'erhang them,
nor foresee aught. Not till the blow has fallen do
they protest and weep too late the accomplished

deed.
