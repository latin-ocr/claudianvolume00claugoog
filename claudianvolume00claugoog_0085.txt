THE FIRsT BOOK AGAINST RUFINUS

calamity, comes upon J ustice sad at beart in her
palace‚ and thus provokes her with horrid utterance z
“ Is this that old reign of peace3 this the return of
that golden age thou fondly hopedst had come to
pass? Is our power gone, and no place now left
for the Furies? Turn thine eyes this way. See
how many cities the barbarians’ fires have laid low,
how vast a slaughter, how· much blood Rufinus*
hath procured for me, and 011 what widespread
death my serpents gorge themselves. Leave thou
the world of men 3 that lot is mine. Mount to the
starS, return to that well-known tract of Autumn
sky where the Standard-bearer dips towards the
south. The space next to the summer constella-
tion of the Lion, the neighbourhood of the winter
Balance has long been empty. And would 1 could
now follow thee through the dome of heaven.”

The goddess made answer ε “ Thou shalt rage no
. further, mad that thou art. Now 311311 thy creature
receive his due, the destined avenger hangs over
him, and he who now wearies land and the very
sky shall die, though no handful of dust shall cover
his corpse. Soon shall come HonoriuS‚ promised of
old to this fortunate age, brave as his father Theo-
dosiUS, brilliant as his brother Arcadius3 he shall
subdue the Medes and overthrow the Indians with
his spear. Kings shall pass under his yoke, frozen
Phasis shall bear his horses’ hooves‚ and Araxes
submit perforce to be bridged by him. Then too
311311 thou be bound with heavy chains of iron and
cast out from the light of day and imprisoned in
the nethermost pit, thy snaky locks overcome and
shorn from thy head. Then the world shall be owned
by all in common, no field marked off from another
