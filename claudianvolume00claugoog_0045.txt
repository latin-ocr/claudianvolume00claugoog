PANEGYRIC ΟΝ PROBINUS AND OLYBRIUS

wish I would not shrink from toiling neath a
Libyan sun nor from the cold winds of a Russian
midwinter. At thy behest Ι will traverse all lands
and fearing no season of the year will hazard Meroe
in summer and the Danube in winter.''

Then the Queen answered: “ Full well know Ι,
far-famed ruler‚ that thy victorious armies toil for
Italy, and that once again servitude and furious
rebels have given way before thee, overthrown in
one and the same battle. Yet I pray thee add to
our late won liberty this further boon, if in very
truth thou still reverest me. There are among my
citizens two young brothers of noble lineage‚ the
dearly loved sons of ProbuS, born on a festal day
and reared in my own bosom. ’Twas I gave the little
ones their cradles when the goddess of childbirth
freed their mother’s womb from its blessed burden
and heaven brought to light her glorious offspring.
To these I would not prefer the noble Decii nor the
brave Metelli, no, nor the Scipios who overcame the
warlike Carthaginians nor the Camilli, that family
fraught with ruin for the Gauls, The Muses have
endowed them with full measure of their skill 3 their
eloquence knows no bounds. Theirs not to wanton
in sloth and banquets spread; unbridled pleasure
tempts them not, nor can the lure of youth under-
mine their characters. Gaiuing from weighty cares
an old man's mind, their fiery youth is bridled
by a greybeard’s wisdom. That fortune to which
their birth entitles them I beg thee assure them
and appoint for them the path of the coming year.
'Tis no unreasonable request and will be no unheard-
of boon] Their birth demands it should be so.
Grant it ; so may Scythian Araxes be our vassal
