FESCENNINE VERSES, IV

Breathe a new loyalty into your breasts and let
your senses kindle a flame that shall never be extin-
guished. May your clasped hands form a bond
more close than that betwixt ivy and flowering
chestnut or poplar and pliant vine. Be the frequent
kisses that ye give and receive breathed more softly
than those of plaintive doves, and when lips have
united soul to soul let sleep still your throbbing
breath. Be the purple couch warm with your
princely wooing‚ and a new stain ennoble coverlets
ruddy with Tyrian dye. Then leap victorious from
the marriage-bed, scarred with the night's encounter.

All night long let the music of the flute resound
and the crowd, set free from law’s harsh restraintS,
with larger licence indulge the permitted jest.
SoldierS, make merry with your leaders, girls with
boys, Be this the cry that re-echoes from pole
to pole, among the peopleS‚ over the seas: “ Fair
Honorius weds wsth Maria.’'
