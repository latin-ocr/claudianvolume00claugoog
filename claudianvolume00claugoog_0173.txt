AGAINST EUTRoans‚ 1 ὓ

own blood must oleanse the consular insignia, the
monster itself must be sacrifioed. Whatever it be
that fate prepares for us and shows forth by such an
omen, let Eutropius' death, I pray, avert it all.

Fortune‚ is thy power so all-embracing? What
is this savage humour of thine ? To what lengths
wilt thou sport with us poor mortals ? If it was thy
will to disgrace the consul's ohair with a servile
occupant let some “ consul ’⁹ come forward with
broken chains, let an escaped jail-bird don the robes
of Quirinus—but at least give us a man. There are
grades even among slaves and a certain dignity;
that slave who has served but one master holds a
position of less infamy. Canst thou count the
waves of the sea, the grains of Africa's sands, if so
thou canst number Eutropius' masters How many
owners has he had, in how many sale-catalogues has
he appeared, how often has he changed his name !
How often has he been stripped while buyer con-
sulted doctor whether there lurked any flaw by reason
of some hidden disease! All repented having bought
him and he always returned to the slave-market
while he could yet fetch a price. When he became
but a foul corpse-like body, a mass of senile pen·-
dulous flesh, his masters were anxious to rid their
houses of him by giving him away as a present and
made haste to foist the loathsome gift on an unsus-
pecting friend. To so many different yokes did he
submit his neck, this slave, old in years but ever
new to the house; there was no end to his servitude
though many beginningS.

He is destined from his very cradle to bloody
tortures; straight from his mother’ s womb he is
hurried away to be made a eunuch3 no sooner born
