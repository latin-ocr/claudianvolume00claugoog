THE WAR AGAINST GILDO, I

Rome, the goddeSS, fearing for her city's destruction
and weak with corn withheld, hastened to the thresh-
old of revolving Olympus with looks unlike her own ;
not with such countenance does she assign laws
to the Britons, or subject the frightened Indians to
her rule. Feeble her voice, slow her step, her eyes
deep buried. Her cheeks were sunken and hunger
had wasted her limbs. Scarce can her weak shoulders

a mass of rust. At last she reaches heaven and
falls at the Thunderer’s feet and utters this mourn-
ful complaint: “ If prophecy rightly foretold the
permanence of the rising walls of Rome3 if the
Sibyl's verse is unalterable; if thou art not yet
wearied of our city and the Capitol, I come to thee
as a suppliant. My prayer is not that a consul
may march in triumph along Araxes' bankS‚ nor that
Rome’s power may crush the archer Persians and
Susa their capital, nor yet that we may plant our
standards on the Red Sea's strand. All this thou
grantedst us of old. 'Tis but food I, Rome, ask for
now 3 father, take pity on thy chosen race and ease
us of this hunger unto death. Whatever thy dis-
pleasure, we have surely sated it. The very Getae
and Suebi would pity our sufferings3 Parthia’s self
would shudder at my disasters. What need have I
to mention the pestilence, the heaps of corpses, the
numberless deaths wherewith the very air is cor-
rupted ? Why tell of Tiber's flooded stream, sweeping
betwixt roofs and threatening the very hills? My
submerged city has borne mighty ships, echoed the
sound of oarS, and experienced Pyrrha’s flood.
