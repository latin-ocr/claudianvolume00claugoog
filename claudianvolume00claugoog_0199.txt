AGAINST EUTROPIUS, I

those that solicit him not. Whatever the senses
desire he cultivates and offers for another’s enj oyment.
That hand will give whatever thou wouldest have. He
performs the functions of all alike ; his dignity loves
to unbend. His meetings 1 and his deserving labours
have won him this reward,2 and he receives the consul's
robe in recompense for the work of his skssful hand.’'

When the rumour concerning this disgrace of the
eastern empire was known to be true and had
impressed belief on Roman earS, Rome’s goddess
thus spake: ‘⁶ Is Eutropius worthy of mine ire? Is
such an one fit cause for Roman grief? ” So saying
the mighty goddess winged her way through the
heavens and with one stroke of her pinions passed
beyond the Po and approached the camp of her
emperor. It happened that even then the august
HonoriuS‚ assisted by his father-in-law Stilicho, was
making answer to the Germans who had come of
their own accord to sue for peace. From his lofty
throne he was dictating laws to the Cauci and giving
a constitution to the flaxen-haired Suebi. Over
these he sets a king, with those he signs a treaty
now that hostages have been demanded3 others he
enters on the list as serviceable allies in war, so that in
future the Sygambrians will cut off their flowing locks
and serve beneath our banners. J oy and love so fill
the goddess’ heart that she well nigh weepS, so great
is her happy pride in her illustrious foster-child. So
when a heifer fights in defence of the herd his mother
lifts her own horns more proudly3 so the African
lioness gazes with admiration on her cub as he grows
to be the terror of the farmsteads and the future

king of beastS. Rome lays aside her veil of cloud and
towers above the youthful warrior, then thus beginS.
