THE THIRD CONSULSHIP OF HONORIUS

that marriage that makes thee kin with me, by the
night that saw its consummation, by the torch

· which at thy wedding-feast the queen carried in

her own hand when she led thy bride-elect from out
the imperial palace, take on thee a father's spirit,
guard the years of their childhood. Was not their sire
thy master and thy wife’s father ? Now, now Ι shall
mount untroubled to the stars for thou wilt watch over
them. Even should Typhoeus rend away the rocks
and leap forth, should Tityus free his captive limbs,
should Enceladus, hurling Etna from him, roar in
rage—each and all will fall before Stilicho's attack.”

He spake no more but still in human form clove
a furrow of light through the clouds ; he passes
to Luna’s globe, leaves Mercury's threshold and
hastens to the gentle airs of Venus, Hence he tra-
verses Phoebus’ path, Mars’ baleful fires and J upiter's
quiet quartem, and stands upon the very crown of
the sky, cold Saturn’s frozen zone. Heaven’s fabric
openS, unbidden the shining doors swing back.
Bootes prepares a place in the vault of the northern
sky, sword-girt Orion unbars the portals of the south 3
they offer welcome to the new star, uncertain
each in turn to what region he will betake himself,
what constellation he will grace with his presence,
or in what quarter he will elect to shine alone.
Ο glory of heaven as once thou wert of earth, the
ocean that laves the shores of the land of thy birth
receives thee wearied with thy nightly course, Spain
bathes thee in thy natal waveS. Happy father, when
first thou risest above the horizon thou lookest upon
ArcadiuS, when thou dippest to thy setting the sight

of Honorius delays thy westering fires. Through '

whichever hemisphere thou takest thy wandering
