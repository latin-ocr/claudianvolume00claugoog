AGAINST EUTROPIUS‚ II

flee before their own captiveS, whom, as Danube’s
stream well knows‚ they once subdued 3 and those
now fear a handful who once could drive back all.

Meanwhile the palace devotes its attention to
dances and feastingS‚ and cares not what be lost so
something remain. But lest our salesman lose
aught by this dismemberment of the empire he
has divided each remaining province into two, and
forces the two halveS, each under its own governor,
to compensate him for the loss of other provinces.
'Tis thus they give me back my lost peoples: by
this ingenious device they increase the number of
my rulers while the lands they should rule are lost.

In thee is now my only hope; in place of
Minerva’s supplicating branch I offer thee my tearS.
Help me in my distreSS. Save me from this tyranny
of a slave master3 do not condemn all for the fault
of a few, and let not a recent offence cancel
former merits. Grant me now my request3 extreme
danger ever exonerates from blame. CamilluS, though
justly angered at his banishment‚ forebore not to
succour his country when in flameS. I seek not to
draw thee away from Italy; thou art enough
defence for both empireS. Let both have the benefit
of thine illustrious arms ; let the same shield defend
us and one hero work the salvation of a twofold
world.''
