INTRODUCTION

Valens himself, but recently returned from his
Persian war, lost his life.

Gratian and his half-brother, Valentinian ΙΙ., who
had become Augusti upon the death of their father,
Valentinian Ι ., in 375, would have had little power
of themselves to withstand the victorious Goths and
Rome might well have fallen thirty years before she
did, had it not been for the force of character and
the military skill of that same Theodosius whose
successes against the Alamanni have already been
mentioned. Theodosius was summoned from his
retirement in Spain and made Augustus (J anuary 19,
379). During the next three years he succeeded,
with the help of the Frankish generals, Bauto and
Arbogast, in gradually driving the Goths northward,
and so relieved the barbarian pressure on the Eastern
Empire and its capital. In 381 Athanaric, the
Gothic king, sued in person for peace at Constan-
tinople and there did homage to the emperor. In
the following year the Visigoths became allies of
Rome and, for a time ,at least, the danger was
averted.

Meanwhile the West was faring not much better.
Gratian, after an uneasy reign, was murdered in 383
by the British pretender, Magnus Maximus. From
383 to 387 Maximus was joint ruler of the West with
Valentinian ΙΙ., whom he had left in command of
Italy rather from motives of policy than of clemency ;
but in the latter year he threw off the mask and,
crossing the Alps, descended upon his colleague
whose court was at Milan. Valentinian fled to
Thessalonica and there threw himself on the mercy
of Theodosius· Once more that general was to save
the situation.
