genuity—that mind of his equal to any emergency.
He will force his way through the desert, his own
greatness will lead him.'’

Thus spake the dead emperor, whereon thus
the son answered: “ Right willingly, father, will I
fulfil thy commands ι ever ready am I to weleome
thy behests. None is dearer to me than my kinsman
Stilicho, Let the impious Gildo atone for his wrongS,
and Africa be restored to my brother still safer

should he behold it ? Why delayest thou ? Up from
thy bed3 attack the rebel; give me back my
prisoner3 waste no more time. ’Tis Fate's gift to
thy family. While yet the raee of Theodosius treads
the earth the palace of Bocchus shall go in fear. Let
the spoils of Gildo be added to those of Firmus3
