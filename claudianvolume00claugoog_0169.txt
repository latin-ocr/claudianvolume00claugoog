THE WAR AGAINST GILDO, I

Africa or Italy. The part that faces Africa is flat
and affords good anchorage for ships ; the northern
shore is inhospitable, rock-bound‚ stormy, and loud
with beating waveS. The sailor curses these wild
cliffs. Here the pestilence falls on men and beastS,
so plague- -ridden and deadly is the air, so omnipotent
the South wind and the North winds banished.
When their much buffeted vessels had given a
wide berth to these dangerS‚ they came to land at
different places on the broken coast· line. Some
are beached at Sulci, a city founded by Carthage
of old. The sea· -wall of Olbia shelters others. The
city of Caralis over against the coast of Libya, a
colony of great Phoenician Carthage, juts out into
the sea and extends into the waveS‚ a little pro-
montory that breaks the force of the opposing
wiuds, Thus in the midst a harbour is found and
in a huge bay the quiet waters lie safe from every
wind. For this harbour they make with every. effort,
and reversing their vessels they await the favouring
breezes of the west wind with fleet at anchor.¹
