THE CONSULSHIP OF MANLIUS

beneath its feet while it treads upon the thunder’s
roar; so thy patient mind, unfettered by cares so
manifold, rises high above them3 thou art ever
the same, no hatred can compel thee, no affection
induce thee, to swerve from the path of justice.

anger from thy voice3 the spirit of moderatiori
shines from thine eyes3 passion never inflames
that glauce or fills with blood the angry veins;
never is a tempest heralded on thy changed coun-

without show of anger and checkest their evil-doing
with unruffled calm. Never dost thou gnash with
thy teeth upon them nor shout orders for them to
be chastised.

godS, he who, weighing the guilt, can with delibera-
tion balance the punishment. Let others boast them
of their bloody swords and wish to be feared for
their ferocity, while they fill their treasuries with
the goods of the condemned. Gently flows the Nile,

no sound reveals its power. More swiftly the broad
Danube glides between its quiet bankS. Huge
Ganges flows down to its mouths with gently moving
current. Let torrents roar horribly‚ threaten weary
