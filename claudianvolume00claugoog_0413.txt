chains of slavery upon their neckS. All those lands
that lie. between Ocean and the Danube trembled
at the approach of one man. Boreas was brought
{fito servitude without a blow3 the Great Bear was
‘sarmed.

· In so short a time didst thou win so many battles
without loss of blood, and, Setting out with the moon
yet new, thou didst return or ever it was full; so
didst thou compel the threatening Rhine to learn
gentleness with shattered hornS‚ that the Salian now
tills his fields, the Sygambrian beats his straight
sword into a curved sickle, and the traveller, as
he looks at the two banks‚ asks over which Rome
rules. The Belgian‚ too, pastures his flock across the
river and the Chauci heed it not; Gallie herds cross
the middle Elbe and wander over the hills of the
Franks. Safe it is to hunt amid the vast silence of
the distant Hercynian forest, and in the woods that
old-established superstition has rendered awful our
axes fell the trees the barbarian once worshipped
and nought is said.

Nay more, devoted to their conqueror this people
offers its arms in his defence. How oft has Germany
begged to add her troops to thine and to join 1161·
forces with those of Rome ! Nor yet was she angered
when her offer was rejected, for though her aid was
refused her loyalty came off with praise. Provence
will sooner drive out the governor thou sendest
than will the land of the Franks expel the ruler
thou hast given them. Not to rout rebels in the
field but to punish them with chains is now the
law 3 under our judge a Roman prison holds inquest
