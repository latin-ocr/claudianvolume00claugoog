ΤΗΕ THIRD CONSULSHIP OF HONORIUS

journey, thou passest over the domains of sons who
with tranquil mind and ripe control rule over allied

chains, mad Ambition and his gold banished afar.
Wealth does not hold sway 3 sense-corrupting gifts
are of no avail ; virtue alone can purchase power.

Brothers twain, with the beart of one, brothers to
whose rule fate has entrusted sea and land, if there

now Vulcan prepares the arms for their subj ection
and Cyclops labours on the Sicilian anvil. Brontes
carves countless figures on the shield, Steropes hastes
* to bend the lofty peak of the flashing helmet, Pyrag-
mon knits the coat of mail, smoky Lipare roars
throughout its fixe-belching caveS. ’T is for you that
Neptune pastures in the sea-weed meadows of the
Ionian main green sea-horses who can fly o'er the
surface of the blue waters with so light a step that
their hoofs are unflecked with foam, and course o’er
fields of corn so delicately that the ears do not bend
beneath their weight. E’en now I see the sack of
Babylon and the Parthian driven to flight that is not
feigned, Bactria subj ected to the Law, the fearful
pallor of the Ganges’ servile bankS, the humbled Per-
sian throwing off his gem-encrusted robeS. Mount
to Tanais' source, explore the frozen North, traverse
sun-scorched Libya, o'ercome the fires of Titan and
surprise Nile's hidden spring3 pass the Pillars of
HerculeS, the bourne, too, whence Bacchus returned 3
whatever heaven enfolds shall own your dominion.
To you the Red Sea shall give precious sheIIS, India
her ivory, Panchaia persumeS, and China silk.
