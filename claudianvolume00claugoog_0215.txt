AGAINST EUTROPIUS, II: PREFACE

wealth thy son shall inherit ? In no other way
couldst thou have been father to an emperor.1 Why
insatiably weary heaven with a woman’s plaints ἓ
Α haven of refuge is prepared for thee on the shores
of Cyprus, Thou hast plunged the world in war with
barbary3 the sea, believe me, is safer than the land.
v No longer wilt thou strike terror into the Armenians
with javelin and bow, no more scour the plain on thy
fleet charger. The senate of Byzantium has been
deprived of thy loved voice3 uncertainty holds the
august assembly that is now deprived of thy counseIS.
Hang up thy toga, retired consul ; hang up thy quiver,
veteran soldier; return to Venus' service 3 that is thy
true calling. The pander's hand knows not to serve
Mars featly; Cytherea will right gladly take back
her slave. Dancing fills the island of CypruS, home
of the happy loves ; there purity commands no
respect. Paphian maidens gaze forth from the high
cliffS, anxious till the wave has brought thy bark safe
to land. Yet sear I lest the Tritons detain thee in
the deep to teach them how they may seduce the
sportive N ereidS, or that those same winds which
hindered Gildo’s flight may seek to drown thee in the
sea. y Tabraca owes its fame to the overthrow of the
Moor ; may Cyprus win prestige from thy shipwreck.
In vain will thy last breath be spent in calling on the

dolphin to carry thee to shore ε his back bears only ¹

men.2 Hereafter should any eunuch attempt to
emulate thine actions let him turn his eye towards

Cyprus and abate his pride.
left (πλε. forfeited) his property ou his banishment to Cyprus

to his “ son ” ArcadiuS.
