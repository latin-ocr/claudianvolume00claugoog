THE FOURTH . CONSULSHIP OF HONORIUS

as a tool by a Frankish outlaw (Arbogast). Both
dared monstrous guilt3 both stained their hands with
an innocent emperor 's 1 blood. Sudden elevation
inspired Maximus with audacity, his failure taught
his successor caution. Maximus was quick to arm
rebellion, Eugenius careful to attempt only what
was safe. The one o 'erran the country, spreading
his forces in allfdirectionS, the other kept his troops
together and himself secure behind a rampart.
Different were they, but in their deaths alike. To
neither was it granted to escape an ignominious end
and to fall in the thick of the ,fight. Gone was their
glory, their weapons were reft from them and„ „they
reduced to their former state3 their arms were
bound behind their backs and they stretched forth
their necks to the sword’s imminent stroke, begging
for pardon and for life. What a fall did pride there
suffer! They who but lately had moved such
countless cohorts with but a nod, into whose palm
a wavering world had hung ready to drop, fall
not as warriors at a victor’ s hand but as malefactore
before a judge3 he sentences with his voice as
criminals those whom he assailed ιιι war as tyrantS.
With both perished their lieutenants: Andragathius
hurled himself from his ship into the waveS, Arbo-
gast took his life with his own sword; the Alps
mark the tomb of theone, the sea of the other.
This solace at least the avenger afforded to those mur-
dered brothers that both the authors of their deaths
themselves were slain3 two victims went to appease
those royal ghostS. Such was Theodosius’ oblation
at their tomb and with the blood of the guilty he
appeased the shades of the two young emperors,
Those triumphs stablished J ustlce on her throne
