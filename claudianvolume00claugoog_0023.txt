than half a century after him, it is hard to withhold
our admiration from a writer who could, at least as
far as his language is concerned, challenge comparison
with poets such as Valerius FlaccuS‚ Silius ItalicuS,
and Statius—poets who flourished about three cen-
turies before him.l I doubt whether, subject matter
set aside, Claudian might not deceive the very elect
into thinking him a contemporary of StatiuS, with

· whose Silvae his own shorter poems have much in
common.

Even as a poet Claudian is not always despicable‚
His descriptions are often elever, e.g·. the AponuS, and
many passages in the ‘⁶ De raptu.'' 2 His treatment
of somewhat commonplace and often threadbare
themes is not seldom successful—for example, the
poem on the Phoenix and a four-line description of
the horses of the dawn in the Panegyric on Honorius’
fourth consulship ³—and he has a happy knack of
phrase-making which often relieves a tedicus page :

latinity with that of his contemporary, the authoress of the
frankly colloquial Pereyrinatio ad loca sancta (see Grand ent,

l. sancta,” in rohiv fv'zr lat. Leaeikoyraphie, iv. 259).

² It is not impossible that this poem is a translation or
at least an adaptation of a Greek (Alexandrine) original.
So Forster, Der Raub und die Roeckkekr der Persephone,
Sthltss‘iiailtgdlg-Yidawns seem to suit him ε cf. i. 1-6).
