THE WAR AGAINST GILDO, I

leaning upon their spears the soldiers throng around
him and attune their ready ears to 1113 inspiring
voice. ‘⁴ My men, so soon to bring defeat upon
Gildo, now is the time to fulffl your promises and
make good your threatS. If you felt indignation
on my behalf, now take up arms and prove it.
Wash out the stain of civil war by means of a great
and deserved triumph. Let the empire of the East
know, let it be plain to all the world, that Gaul can
only owe defeat to the badness of a cause, not to
her enemies' strength.l Let not Gildo affright you
though he have all barbary at 1113 back. Shall Moors
stand up against the shock of your clashing shields
and the near threat of your swords ? You shall not
oppose men armed with shields or shining bladeS.
These savages put their trust in javelins hurled from
afar, Once he has discharged his missile the enemy
will be disarmed. With his right hand he hurls
1113 spear, with 1113 left he holds his cloak before him ;
no other armour has the horseman. His steed
knows not the rein 3 a whip controls it. Obedience
and discipline are unknown 111 111011 ranks, Their
arms are a burden to them, their salvation lies in
flight. Though each has many wiveS, ties of family
bind them not, nor have they any love for their
children whose very number causes affection to fail.
Such are the troops, The chief will come to battle
crowned with roseS, drenched with scentS, his last
feast still undigested3 drunken with wine, foredone
with eld, enervated with disease and venery. Let
the war trumpet rouse him from a bed of incest, let
him beg aid of lutes and choirS, for he likes not the
clarion's note, and let him learn (all unwilling) to
spend in war nights that he now dedicates to love.
