THE FIRST BOOK AGAINST RUFINUS
PREFACE

(Π)

When Python had fallen, laid low by the arrow of
Phoebus, his dying limbs outspread o'er Cirrha’s
heights—Python‚ whose coils covered whole moun-
tainS‚ whose maw swallowed rivers and whose
bloody erest touched the stars — then Parnassus
was free and the woodS‚ their serpent fetters shaken
off, began to grow tall with lofty trees, The moun-
tain - asheS‚ long shaken by the dragon's sinuous
coiIS, spread their leaves securely to the breeze‚ and
Cephisus, who 'had so often foamed with his poisonous
venom‚ now flowed a purer stream with limpid
wave. The whole country echoed with the cry,

“hail‚ Healer'’ ‚every land sang Phoebus’ praise. A
fuller wind shakes the tripod, and the godS‚ hearing
the Muses’ sweet song from afar off, gather in the
dread caverns of Themis,

A blessed band comes together to hear my song,
now that a second Python has been slain by the
weapons of that master of ours who made the rule
of the brother Emperors hold the world steady,
observing justice in peace and showing vigour
ln war.
