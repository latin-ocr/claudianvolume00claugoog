EPITHALAMIUM

neSS, and white hairs come hastening to increase
the reverence of thy face. Though dignity be the
crown of age and strength, by a far different lot, of
youth, yet either season decks thee with its own
peculiar honours, Thou art the ornament of fortune.
Never tookst thou up the sword for hurt nor ever
didst steep its blade in citizens' blood. No cruelties
on thy part aroused men’s hatred 3 favouritism never
slacks the reins of justice. We love thee, yet we
sear thee. Our very fear testifies to our love, O thou
most righteous interpreter of Law, guardian most
sure of peace with honour, greatest of our generaIS,
most blessed among the fathers of our country.
We all confess that now we owe our emperor an even
firmer allegiance sor that thou, hero invincible, art
the father of his bride. Crown thy head with a
garland, lay aside thy rank for a moment and join
our danceS. An thou dost this, so may thy son
Eucherius 1 surpass the virtues of his sire3 so may
the fair T hermantia,1 thy daughter, live to see a
marriage such as this; so may Maria’s womb grow

big and a little HonoriuS, born in the purple, rest
on his grandsire’s lap.'’
