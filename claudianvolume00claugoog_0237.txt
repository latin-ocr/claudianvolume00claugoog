AGAIN ST EUTROPIUS‚ II

Celaenae. Hence flow four broad auriferous rivers·
Small wonder that the waters in which King Midas
bathed so often glitter with the rare metal. Two flow
north, two southwardS. Dindymus gives birth to
the river SangariuS, which, swollen by the clear
stream of the Gallus, hastens on to the Euxine, the
sea of the Amazon. The conjoined streams of
Marsyas and Meander make for the Icarian main
and Mycale ’s strand. Marsyas flows fast and straight
while his course is his own 3 mingled with thy waterS,
Meander‚ he goes slowly—unlike the Saone whose
waters are hastened by the Rhone's inflowing.
Between these rivers is a sun-kissed plain3 kindly
is it to the corn, thick-set with vines and displaying
the fruit of the grey-green olive ; rich, too, in horseS,
fertile in flockS‚ and wealthy with the purple-veined
marble that Synnada quarries.

Such was Phrygia then when the gods allowed it
to be ravaged by Getic brigandS. The barbarian
burst in upon those cities so peaceful, so easy of
capture. There was no hop'e of safety, no chance
of escape. Long and peaceful ages had made the
crumbling stones of their battlements to fall.

Meanwhile Cybele was seated amid the hallowed
rocks of cold Ida, watching, as is her wont, the
dance, and inciting the joyous Curetes to brandish
their swords at the sound of the drum, when, 10, the
golden -turreted crown, the eternal glory of her
blessed hair, fell from off her head and, rolling from
her brow, the castellated diadem is profaned in the
dust. The Corybantes stopped in amazement at
this omen ; general alarm checked their orgies
and -silenced their pipeS. The mother of the gods
wept ; then spake thus in sorrow.
