 

INTRODUCTION

on Claudian and his circle by Sudermann’s play, Die
Lobgesc‘z‘nge des Claudian (Berlin, 1914).

All Claudian's genuine works are translated in the
present volumes with the exception of the two-line
fragment “ De Lanario ” (Birt, c.m.c. lii [lxxxviii.)].
The appendix “ vel spuria vel suspecta continens '
has been rejected both by Birt and Koch, and I
have in this followed their example. The eight
Greek poems attributed to Claudian are at least of
doubtful authenticity, though Birt certainly makes
out a good case for the ‘⁶ Gigantomachia '’ (a fragment
of 77 lines). The remainder consists of short epi-
gramS, two on the well-worn theme of the water
enclosed in the crystal and two Christian oneS.
These last are almost certainly not the work of
Claudius Claudianus but of Claudianus Mamertus,
presbyter of Vienne circ. 474 A.D. We know from
Sidonius (Ep. iv. 3. 8) that this Claudian was a
writer of sacred poetry both in Greek and Latin
—indeed the famous “ Pange lingua '' is attributed
to him.

A word should perhaps be said as to the numbering
of the poemS.

It is much to be regretted that Birt did not cut
adrift from Gesner’s system, or at least that he
only did so in the “ Carmina minora.'' The resultant
discrepancy in his (and Koch’s) edition between the
order of the poems and their numbering is un-
doubtedly a nuisance, but I have not felt justified,
in so slight a work as the present one, in departing
from the now traditional arrangement.
