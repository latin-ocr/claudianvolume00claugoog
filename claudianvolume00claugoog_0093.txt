THE SECOND BOOK AGAINST RUFINUS

mine own death, nor will 1 die (for I am no c'oward)
till 1 have accomplished this. ,Ι will not lay down
my power before my life.'’

So spake he, and as if Aeolus unchained the winds
so he, breaking their bondS, let loose the nations,
clearing the way for war ; and, that no land should
be free therefrom, apportioned ruin throughout
the world, parcelling out destruction. Some pour
across the frozen surface of swift-flowing Danube
and break with the chariot wheel what erstwhile
knew but the oar ; others invade the wealthy East‚
led through the Caspian Gates and over the Armenian
snows by a newly-discovered pass‚ The fields of
Cappadocia reek with slaughter3 ArganS‚ father
of swift horseS, is laid waste. Halys’ deep waters
run red and the Cilician cannot defend himself
in his precipitous mountainS. The pleasant plains of
Syria are devastated‚ and the enemy's cavalry
thunders along the banks of OronteS, home hitherto
of thev dance and of a happy people's song. Hence
comes mourning to Asia, while Europe is left to be
the sport and prey of Getic hordes even to the borders
of fertile Dalmatia. All that tract of land lying
between the stormy Euxine and the Adriatic is laid
waste and plundered, no inhabitants dwell there3
’tis like torrid Africa whose sun-scorched plains never
grow kindlier ¹through human tillage. Tbessaly
is afire ; 'Pelion silent, his shepherds put to flight ;μ
flames bring destruction on Macedonia's cropS.
For Pannonia's plain, the Thracians' helpless citieS‚
the fields of1Mysia were ruined but now none wept;
year by year came the invader, unsheltered was the
countryside stom havoc and custom had robbed
suffering of its sting. Alas‚ in how swift ruin perish
