statement that Stilicho, in swimming the Addua,
showed greater bravery than Horatius Cocles be-
cause, while the latter swam away from Lars Por-
senna, the former ‘⁴ dabat . . . Geticis pectora
bellis.” 1

Two of the poems are interesting as touching upon
Christianity (Carm. min. corp. xxxii. “ De salvatore,'’
and 1. “ In Iacobum''). The second of these two
poems can scarcely be held to be serioUS, and although
the first is unobjectionable it cannot be said to stamp
its author as a sincere Christian. Orosius 2 and
S. Augustine ³ both declare him to have been a
heathen, but it is probable that, like his master Δ
Stilicho, Claudian rendered the new and orthodox
religion at least lip-service.

It seems likely that after the death of Claudian
(404) and that of his hero, Stilicho, the political
poems (with the exception of the Panegyric on
Probinus and Olybrius,4 which did not concern
Stilicho) were collected and published separately.
The “ Carmina minora ’' may have been published
about the same time. The subsequent conflation of
these two portions came to be known as “ Claudianus
maior,” the “ De raptu '' being “ Claudianus minor.”

lThe mss, of Claudian's poems fall into two main
c asses ι

(1) Those which Birt refers to as the Codices

¹ xxviii. 490.
² vii. 35 ‘⁶ Paganus pervicacissimu3.''
² civ. dei, v· 26 “a Christi numine alienuS.'’

4 This poem does not seem to have been associated with
the others till the 12th century.
