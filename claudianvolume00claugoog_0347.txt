PoruS‚ wept at the constant news of Philip's fortune,
telling his companions who rejoiced thereat that his
sire’s valour left him nought to conquer. In thee
Ι see like spirit. May a‘ father be allowed this
prophecy—“ thou shalt be as great ” ἔ It is not to
my goodwill thou owest the kingdom, for nature
has already made it thine. So even from his birth
bees reverence the king ¹ who is to lead their
buzzing swarms through the soft meadows‚ ask his
public laws for the gathering of the honey and
entrust to him their combS. So the spirited young
heifer claims sovereignty over the grazing-grounds
and, though as yet his horns are not grown strong,
lords it over the herd. N ay: postpone thy cam—
paigns till thou art a man and while Ι do battle
patiently help thy brother to fulfil my office. Be

you two the terror of untamed Araxes and of swift ‘

Euphrates; may Nile throughout all his length
belong to you and all the lands upon which the
morning sun lets fall his beam. Should Ι force a
passage over the Alps, should success crown the
juster cause, thou shalt come and govern the re-
covered provinceS‚ whereby fierce Gaul shall obey
thy laws and my native Spain be guided by thy
just rule. Then, careless of doom and rejoicing in
my labourS, Ι shall quit this mortal life, while you,
my sonS, rule either hemisphere.

· “ Meanwhile cultivate the Muses whilst thou art
yet young; read of deeds thou soon mayest rival ;
never may Greece's story, never may Rome’S, cease
to speak with thee. Study the lives of the heroes
of old to accustom thee for wars that are to be.
