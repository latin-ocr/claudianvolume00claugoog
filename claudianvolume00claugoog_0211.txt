AGAINST EUTROPIUS
BOOK Η( PREFACE
(xlx)

The 110ny born Eutropius who but lately wielded
the reins of supreme power once more fears the
familiar blows ς and, soon to feel the wonted shackles
about his halting feet, he laments that his threats
against his masters have idly vanished. Fortune,
having had enough of her mad freak, has thrust
him forth from his high office and restored him to his
old wa)r of life. He now prepares to hew wood with
axe other than the consular and is at last scourged
with the rods he once proudly carried. To the
punishment set in motion by him when consul he
himself as consul succumbed3 the year that brought
him his robe of office brought him his exile. That
omen of evil augury for the people turns against
itself, the portent of that consulship brings ruin to
the consul. That name erased, our annals breathe
once more, ⁸ and better health is restored . to the
palace now that it has at last vomited forth its poison..
His friends deny him, his accomplices abandon him ;
in his fall is involved all the eunuch band, overcome
not in battle, subdued not by siege—they may not
die a man's death. A mere stroke of the pen has
wrought their undoing‚ a simple letter has fulfilled
Mars' savage work.
