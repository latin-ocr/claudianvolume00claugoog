have seen, was accorded to him by the wishes of the
emperor and at the demand of the senate.

The last of Claudian's datable public poems is
that on the sixth consulship of Honorius. It was
composed probably towards the end of 403 and
recited in Rome on (or after) the occasion of the
emperor’s triumphant entry into the city. The
emperor had just returned after inflicting a defeat
on the Goths at Verona in the summer of 403. It
is reasonable to suppose that this triumphant entry
(to which the poem refers in some detail, ll. 331-639)
took place on the day on which the emperor assumed
the consular office, viz. J anuary 3, 404.

In the year 404 Claudian seems to have married
some protegee of Serena’S. Of the two poems ad-
dressed to her the ‘⁶ Laus Serenae ” is clearly the
earlier, and wc may take the other, the “ Epistola ad
Serenam,'' to be the last poem Claudian ever wrote.
It is a poem which seems to have been written on
his honeymoon, during the course of which he died.l

It is not easy to arrive at any just estimate of
Claudian as a writer, partly because of an inevitable ’
tendency to confuse relative with absolute standardS,
and partly (and it is saying much the same thing in
other words) because it is so hard to separate
Claudian the poet from Claudian the manipulator of
the Latin language. If we compare his latinity
with that. of his contemporaries (with the possible
exception of Rutilius) or with that of such a poet
as Sidonius Apollinaris , who came not much more
