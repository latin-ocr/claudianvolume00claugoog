INTRODUCTI ΟΝ

Plantin ed. (Scaliger), 1603.

Elzevir ed. (Heinsius), Leyden, 1650.
Amsterdam, 1665.

Barth, Hanau, 1612.
Frankfort, 1650.

Delphin ed. (Pyrrho), PariS, 1677.

Burmann, Amsterdam, 1760.

Konig, Gottingen, 1808.

These last three have good explanatory noteS.

The first critical edition is that of L. Jeep (Leipzig,

In 183)ss Birt published what must be considered
as the standard edition of Claudian—vol. x. in the
Monumenta Germaniae historica series. Birt was
the first to put the ⁴ text of Claudian on a firm
footing, and it is his edition that Ι have followed,
appending critical notes only where Ι differ from
him.1

The latest edition of Claudian is that of Koch
(Teubner, Leipzig, 1893). Koch was long associated
with Birt in his researches into textual questions
connected with Claudian, and his text is substantially
the same as that of Birt.

¹ I should like if possible to anticipate criticism by
frankly stating that the text of this edition makes no claims
to being based on scientific principles. I have followed-Birt
not because I think him invariably right but because his
is at present the standard text. Where I differ from him
(and this is but in a few places) I do so not because Ι prefer
the authority of another MS. or because I am convinced of
the rightness of a conjecture, but because Birt’s conservatism
commits him (in my opinion) to untranslatable readingS,
in which cases my choice of a variant is arbitrary. Of
the principle of difficilior lectio I pragmatically take no
account.
