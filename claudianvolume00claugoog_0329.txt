THE FOURTH CONSULSHIP OF HONORIUS

outraged by garb profane, were laid upon a hal-
lowed lap. Spain with its rivers of gold gave birth
to thy sire 3 Bosporus boasts thee among its children.
The West is the eradle of thy race but the' East
was thine own nurse 3 rivals are they for so dear a
pledge, either hemisphere elaims thee as its citizen.
The fame of Hercules and Bacchus has immortalized
-Thebes ; when Latona gave birth to Apollo in
Delos that island stayed its errant course3 it is
Crete’s boast that over its fields the infant Thunderer
crawled. But the land that brought divine Honorius
to birth is a greater than DeloS, a more famous than
Crete. Such narrow shores would not suffice our
god. Nor did the bleak rocks of Cynthus hurt thy
body with their rough bed 3 on couch of gold,
clothed in jewelled raiment, thy mother gave birth
to thee amid Tyrian purples 3 a palaee rang with
joy at that royal deliverance. What presages were
there not then of future prosperity ? what songs of
birds, what flights of good· omen in the heavens ἲ
What was the hurrying to and fro of seers? Horned ,
Ammon and Delphi so long dumb at length broke
their silence3 Persian magi prophesied thy triumphs3
Tuscan augurs felt thine influence ; seers of Babylon
. beheld the stars and trembled3 amazement seized
the Chaldaean priests 3 the roek of Cumae, shrine
of raging Sibyl, thundered once again. Cybele 's
corybants surrounded not thy cradle with the elatter
of their brazen shields3 a shinin host stood by
thee on every side. Standards o war hedged in
the royal babe who marked the bowed helmets of
the worshipping soldiery while the trumpet’s blare
answered his warlike crieS.

The day that gave thee birth gave thee a kingdom 3
