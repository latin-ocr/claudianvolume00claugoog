AGAINST EUTROPIUS, II

that shall redden Sangarius' waves3 for all the

my son’S‚ the Thunderer's, will. A like disaster
awaits the neighbouring peoples; in vain does
Lydia invoke the thyrsus of Bacchus in her defence.

standing with closed eyes and hiding its head,
believing, poor fool, it cannot be seen by those
whom itself cannot see. None the less Eutropius
