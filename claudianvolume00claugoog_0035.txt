 

THE POEMS OF CLAUDIAN

PANEGYRIC ΟΝ ΤΗΕ CONSULS PROBINUS
AND OLYBRIUS

I

SUN, that eneirelest the world with reins of flame
and rollest in eeaseless motion the revolving centurieS,
seatter thy light with kindlier beams and let thy
courserS‚ their manes combed and they breathing
forth a rosy flame from their foaming bits, elimb
the heavens more jocund in their loftier drawn
chariot. Now let the year bend its new steps for
the consul brothers and the glad months take their
be ‘nnin .

{hou gottest of the Auchenian 1 race nor are the
powerful Anniadae unknown to thee, for thou oft
hast started thy yearly journey with them as consuls

ν and hast given their name to thy revolution. For

them Fortune neither hangs on uncertain favour nor
changeS, but honourS, firmly fixed, pass to all their
kin. Seleet what man thou wilt from their family,
’tis certain he is a eonsul's son. Their ancestors are

related by intermarriage to the Anician z ay. Annius Bassus
(eos, 331) who married the daughter of Annius Anicius
1 ulianus (cos, 322).
