captive monsterS, laying aside her bloodthirsty bow.
Let bears be gathered together, whereat‚ as they
charge with mighty bulk, Helice may gaze in wonder
from Lycaon's stars.l Let smitten lions roar till the
people turn pale, lions such as Cybele would be

Hercules strangle in his mighty arms. May leopardS,

’ lightning-swift‚ hasten to meet the spear's wound,

beasts that are born of an adulterous union what

' time the spotted sire did violence to the nobler lion's

mate ε of such beasts their markings recall the sire,
their courage the dam. Whatsoever is nourished
by the fields of Gaetulia rich in monsterS‚ whatsoever
lurks beneath Alpine snows or in Gallic woodS‚ let
it fall before the spear. Let large streams of
blood enrich the arena and the spectacle leave
whole mountains desolate.

“ Nor let gentler games lack the delights we bring t

finger stirs the lyre, the slippered comedian to whose
voice the theatre re-echoes, the tragedian towering
on his loftier buskin ; him too whose light touch can
elicit loud music from those pipes of bronze that
sound a thousand diverse notes beneath his wander-
ing fingers and who by means of a lever stirs to song
the labouring water.2 Let us see acrobats who hurl
themselves through the air like birds and build
