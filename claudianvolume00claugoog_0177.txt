AGAINST EUTROPIUS, Ι

a mother’s dignity compensates for the lost charms
of a wife. Me Lucina, goddess of childbirth, will
not come near ; I have no children on whom to rely.
Love perishes with my beauty3 the roses of my
cheeks are faded. What wits can save my wretched
back from blows ? How can I, an old man, please Ρ ”

So saying he entered upon the skilled profession
of a pander. His whole heart was in his work;
he knew his business well and was master of every
stratagem for the undoing of chastity. vNo amount
of vigilance could protect the marriage-bed from
his attack 3 no bars could shut him out. He would
have haled even Danae from her refuge in the
brazen tower. He would represent his patron as
dying of love. Was the lady stubborn‚ he would
win her by his patience 3 was she greedy, by a gift ;
flighty, he would corrupt her with a jest. None
could arrest the attention of a maidservant with
so neat a touch as he, none twitch aside a dress so
lightly and whisper his shameful message in her
ear. Never was any so skilled to choose a scene
for the criminal meeting, or so clever at avoiding
the wrath of the cuckold husband should the plot
be discovered. One thought of Lais of Corinth, to
whom the enamoured youth of that city brought
wealth from its twin seaS, wh0, when her grey

hair could no longer go crowned with roseS, when
⁸ the emulous crowd of her admirers ceased nightly to
haunt her doors and but few were left to knock there-
at, when before the mirror's verdict age shrank back
in horror from itself‚ yet stood, still faithful to her call-
ing, and as a pander dressed others for the part, haunt-
ing still the brothel she had loved so well and so long,
and still pandering to the tastes old age forbade her.
