EPITHALAMIUM OF HONORIUS AND
MARIA

PREFACE
(IX)

When Pelion reared his height 'to form a bridal
chamber with long-drawn archeS, and his hospitable
land could not contain so many gods ; when Nereus,
sire of the bride, and all the throng of her sisters
strove to link day to day with feastings 3 when Chiron,
lying at ease with his horse-flanks curled under him,
offered the loving-cup to Jove 3 when Peneus turned
his cold waters to nectar and frothing wine flowed
down from Oeta's summit, Terpsichore struck her
ready lyre with festive hand and led the girlish
bands into the caves, The godS, the Thunderer
himself, disdained not these songs, for they knew
that lovers’ vows ever harmonized with tender strainS.
Centaurs and Fauns would have none of it ε what
lyre could touch Rhoetus or move inhuman Pholus ?

The seventh day had flamed in heaven, seven
times had Hesperus relumed his lamp and seen the
dances completed3 then Phoebus touched his lyre
with that nobler quill, wherewith he leads captive
rocks and mountain-asheS, and sang to his sacred
strings now the promised birth of Achilles, now the
slaughter of the T rojans and the river SimoiS. The
happy marriage-cry re-echoed o'er leafy OlympuS, and
Othrys and Ossa gave back their mistress Thetis’ name .
