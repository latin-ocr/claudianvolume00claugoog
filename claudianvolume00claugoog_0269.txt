FESCENNINE VERSES, III—IV

111 (xm)

Twine with a soft garland‚ Stilicho, the locks
whereon a helmet is wont to shine. Let the trumpets
of war cease and the propitious torch of marriage
banish savage Mars afar. Let regal blood unite once
more with regal blood. Pei-form a father’s office
and unite these children with thine illustrious hand.
Thou didst marry an emperor’s daughter, now, in
turn, thy daughter shall marry an emperor. What
room is here for the madness of jealousy? What
excuse for envy? Stilicho is father both of bride

and bridegroom.

HesperuS‚ loved of VenuS, rises and shines for the
marriage with his Idalian 1 rayS. Maiden shame now
overcomes the anxious bride ; her veil now shows
traces of innocent tearS. Hesitate not to be close
in thine attackS, young lover, e'en though she oppose
thee savagely with cruel finger-nail. None can
enjoy the scents of spring nor steal the honey of
Hybla from its fastnesses if he fears that thorns
may scratch his face. Thorns arm the rose and
bees find a defence for their honey. The refusals
of coyness do but increase the joy ; the desire for
that which flies us is the more inflamed 3 sweeter is
the kiss snatched through tearS. ‚How oft wilt
thou say ε “ Better this than ten victories over the
yellow-haired Sarmatae '' Ξ

t ¹V1dalian= from Idalium, a mountain in CypruS‚ sacred
