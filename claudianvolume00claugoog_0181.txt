AGAINST EUTROPIUS, I

in contact with him, scaring children, disgusting
those that sat at meat, disgracing his fellow-slaveS,
or terrifying as with an evil omen those that met
him3 when his masters ceased to derive any advan-
ta e from that withered trunk (for his wasted limbs
re used even to make the beds or cut wood for the
kitchen fire‚ while his faithless nature forbade their
entrusting him with the charge of gold or vesture
or the secrets of the house—who could bring him to
entrust his marriage-chamber to a pander ?)‚ then at
last they thrust him from their houses like a trouble-
some corpse or an ill-omened ghost. He was now
free--for everyone despised him. So a shepherd
chains up a dog and fattens him with milk while
yet his strength avails to guard the flock and, ever
watchful, to scare away wolves with his barking.
But when later this same dog grows old and dirty
and droops his mangy ears he looses him, and, taking
off his collar, at least saves that.

Universal contempt is sometimes a boon. Driven
out by all, he could freely range amid' every sort of
crime, and open a way for destiny. Oh thou,
whosoe’er thou art, that holdest sway in OlympuS,
was it thy humour to make such mockery of man-
kind? He who was not suffered to perform the
duties of a slave is admitted to the administration
of an empire; him whom a private house scorned
as a servant, a palaee tolerates as its lord. When
first the consular residence received this old vixen‚
who did not lament ? Who grieved not to see an oft-
sold corpse worm itself into the sacred service of the
emperor? Nay, the very palace-servantS, holding a
prouder rank in slavery‚ murmured at such a colleague
and long haughtily scorned his company.
