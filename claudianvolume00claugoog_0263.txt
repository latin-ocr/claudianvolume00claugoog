FESCENNINE VERSES IN HONOUR OF THE
MARRIAGE OF THE EMPEROR HONORIUS1

1 (xl)

Prince‚ fairer than the day-star, who shootest thine
arrows with an aim more sure than the Parthian’S,
rider more daring than the Geloni, what praise
shall match thy lofty mind, what praise thy brilliant
beauty? Leda would rather have thee her son ⁴
than Castor3 Thetis counts thee dearer than her
own Achilles ; Delos’ isle admits thee Apollo's
victor3 Lydia puts Bacchus second to thee. When
in the heat of the chase thou guidest thy coursing
steed amid the towering hohn-oaks and thy tossing
looks stream out upon the wind, the beasts of their
own accord will fall before thine arrows and the
lion, right gladly wounded by a prince’s sacred
hand, will welcome thy spear and be proud so to
die. Venus scorns Adonis returned from the dead,
Diana disapproves Hippolytus recalled to life.

When after thy toils thou seekest the shade of a
green plane-tree or shunnest Sirius’ extreme heat
in some cool grot and freest thy wearied limbs in
sleep, what a passion of love will inflame the Dryads’
hearts ! how many a Naiad will steal up with
trembling foot and snatch an unmarked kiss Ξ Wh0‚

² The marriage of Honorius and Maria, daughter of
Stilicho, took place at Milan, Feb. 398. 231
