ΟΝ STILICHO'S CONSULSHIP, I

Yet Porus was defeated by Alexander, Memnon by
Achilles, and Gildo by thee.

It was not, however, only the South that fierce
Mars aroused but also the East. Though loyalty
cried out against it Gildo had transferred the nominal
rule of Libya to the Eastern empire, cloaking his
base treason under the name of legitimate govern-
ment.1 Thus with diverse terror a twofold war
arose3 here were arms, there were wiles. Africa
supported the one with 1161 savage tribeS, the other
’ the conspiring East nurtured with treachery. From
Byzantium came edicts to subvert the loyalty of
governors3 from Africa that refused her crops black
famine pressed and had beleaguered trembling Rome.
Libya openly meditated our destruction3 over the
civic strife shame had laid her veil of silence.

Though such storms raged on either hand, though
the twofold tempest buffeted the torn empire
on this side and on that, no whit did our consul’s
courage yield to wearineSS, but ever watchful
against threatening doom and soon to win pros-
perous issue, shone greater amid dangers· as the
ship' 5 pilot, tossed in mid Aegean by the storms of
rainy Orion, eludes the waves' buffetings by the
least turn o’f the tiller, skilfully guiding his vessel
now on straight, now on slanting course, and struggles
successfully against the conjoint fury of sea and sky.

At what, Stilicho, shall I first marvel? At the
providence that resisted all intrigues, whereby no
treacherous missive, no bribe—fraught hand escaped
thy notice? Or because that amid the general
terror thou spakest no word unworthy of Latium?
Or because thou didst ever give haughty
answer to the East and later made that answer
