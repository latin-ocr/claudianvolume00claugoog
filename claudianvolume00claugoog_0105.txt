THE SECOND BOOK AGAINST RUFINUS

of war, Arcadia and Sparta's citadel would have
remained unravaged. Burning Corinth would not
have heated the waves of her two seaS‚ nor would
cruel chains have led in captivity the matrons of
Athens, That day might have set an end to our
disasters and destroyed the seeds of future calamitieS.
For shame, envious Fortune, of what a triumph didst
thou rob us ! The kingly mandate came to Stilicho
in arms amid the cavalry and the trumpets’ din.

He stood amazed 3 anger and great grief o'erwhelm
the hero and he wonders that such power for ill is
allowed a coward. His wavering mind ponders the
uncertain issue : ι shall he continue his advance or fail
his brave beginnings ? He longs to stem Illyria’s
ruin but ¹fears> to disobey orders. Loyalty annuls the
prickings-on of valour. The public good urges him
one way, fear of the emperor’s displeasure another.
At length in his distress he raises his hands to
heaven and speaks from deep within his heart: ‘⁴ Ye
gods not yet glutted with Rome’s destruction, if
ye will that our empire be utterly uprooted, if ye
have resolved to blot out all the centuries with
one blow‚ if -ye repent you of the race of man, then
let the sea's unrestrained fury burst forth upon the
land or let Phaethon, deviating from his ordained
course, drive his straying chariot at random. Shall
Rufinus be your tool ? ’Twere shame that such an
one should be the author of the world's destruction.
O the grief of it 2 recalled in mid fight3 forced to lay
down the swords we have drawn 1 Cities marked out
for the flameS, walls doomed to destruction, Ι call
you to witness: see, Ῑ retire; Ῑ leave the unhappy
world to its fate. Turn your banners‚ captains 3 to
your homes ,soldiers of the east. Needs must we obey.
