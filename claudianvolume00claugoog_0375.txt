THE CONSULSHIP OF MANLIUS

direction of the entire ship3 so when thou hadst
long given illustrious proofs of thy character, the
empire of Rome summoned thee to govern not a
part but the whole of itself, and set thee as ruler over
all the rulers of the world. The seas of Spain, the
German ocean obeyed thee and Britain, so far
removed from our continent. Rivers of all lands
observed thy statutes, slow - flowing Saone, swift
Rhone, and Ebro rich in gold. How often did the
Rhine, in those districts where the barbarians dwell,
lament that the blessings of thy rule extended

bathes in its rays, all that its last brilliance illumines
are entrusted to the charge of one man.

So swiftly did thy career fill office after office3
a single period of life was enough for the round of
dignities and gave to thy youthful years every step
on fortune’s ladder.

When repose was earned and now, after reaching
the highest place, glory, laying care aside, seeks
refuge in a private life, genius again wins reward
from other tasks. No part of life is lost ε all that is
withdrawn from the law courts is devoted to the
study, and thy mind in turn either bestows its efforts
on the State or its leisure on the Muses. Once
more thou readest the secrets of ancient Athens,
examining the discoveries with which each sage
has enriched posterity and noting what hosts of
disciples the varying schools produce.

For some hold that air 1 is the first beginning of
all things, others that water is, others again derive
the sum of things from fire. Another, destined to

space. “Hi ” (82) = DemocrituS, EpicuruS, and other
atomists. ‘⁶ Alii ’' (88) are the Platonists.
