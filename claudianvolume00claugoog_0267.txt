FESCENNINE VERSES, II

reeds and Padus make answer with his amber-
dripping alderS. Let Tiber’s banks now ring with
the voices of Rome’s full-fed citizens and the golden
city, ffijlpicin'gh {in her lord’s marriage, crown her
seven s wi owerS.

Let Spain hear afar, Spain the cradle of the im-
perial race‚ where is a house that is mother of
emperorS, rich in crowns of laurel, whose triumphs
can scarce be numbered. Hence came the bride-
groom's sire, hence the bride’s mother ; from either
branch flows the blood of the CaesarS, like twin
streams reunited. Let rich herbage clothe Baetis’
banks and Tagus swell his golden flood ; may ocean,
ancestor of the imperial race‚ make merry in his
crystal caves· Let East and West‚ the two brothers'
reahnS, join in their applause‚ and peace and joy
fill the cities illumined by the sun at his rising and
at his setting. Be still, ye storms of the north and
ye mad blasts of Caurus3 sounding Auster, sink
to rest. Let Zephyrus have sole rule over this
year of triumph.
