ΟΝ STILICHO'S CONSULSHIP‚ I .

on the crimes of kingS. Marcomeres and Sunno 1
give proof ε the one underwent exile in Etruria, the
other, proclaiming himself the exile's avenger, fell
beneath the swords of his own soldierS. Both were
eager to arouse rebellion, both hated peace—true
brothers in character and in a common love of crime.

After the conquest of the north arose a fresh storm
in another quarter. The trumpets of war rang out
in the south that there might be no part of the world
untouched by thy victorieS. Gildo stirred up all
the Moorish tribes living beneath mount Atlas and
those whom the excessive heat of the sun cuts off from
us in the interior of Africa, those too whom Cinyps'
wandering stream waters, and Triton, neighbour of
the garden of the Hesperides ; those who dwell
beside the waters of Gir, most famous of the rivers of
Ethiopia, that overflows his banks as it had been
another Nile. There came at his ·summons the
Nubian with his head—dress of short arroWS‚ the fleet
Garamantian‚ the Nasamonian whose impetuous
ardour not even the sinister predictions of Ammon
could restrain. The plain of Numidia was overrun,
their dust covered the Gaetulian Syrtes; the sky
of Carthage was darkened with their arrOWS. Some,
mounted, guide their horses with stickS, others are
clad in tawny lion—skins and pelts of the nameless
animals that range the vast deserts of Meroe.
Severed heads of serpents with gaping jaws serve
them for helmets, the bright scaly skin of the viper
fashions their quiverS. Simois trembled not so
violently when swart Memnon led his dusky troops
o’er Ida's summit. Not so fearful was Ganges when
Porus approached, mounted on his towering elephant
and surrounded with his far-shooting Indian soldiery.
