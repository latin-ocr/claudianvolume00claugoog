Eagles may not rear their young without the sun's

forth, after that the warmth of their mother’s body
has cracked the opening egg, the father bird makes
haste to carry the unfledged nestlings aloft and bids
them gaze at the sun’s fires with unblinking eye. He
takes counsel of those bright beams and under light’s
schooling makes trial of the strength and temper of
his sons· The angry father strikes with pitiless
talons the degenerate who turns away his glauce, but
he whose eye can bear the searching flame, who with
bolder sight can outstare the noonday sun, is brought
up a king of birds, heir to the thunderbolt, destined
to carry J ove's three-forked weapon. So mighty
Rome fears not to send me, oft tested e’er now in the
Muses’ cavernS, to face the emperor, her god. Now
have I won an emperor's ear, the entrance to an
emperor's palace and the emperor himself as judge
of my lyre’s song.
