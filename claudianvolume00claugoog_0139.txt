THE WAR AGAINST GILDO, I

been subdued‚ dishonoured now and poverty-stricken,
bends beneath the cruel lash of peace, and though
not openly beleaguered by any foe yet has all the
hazard of a siege. Destruction threatens me
hourly ; a few days will set a limit to my uncertain
food-supply. Out upon thee, prosperity Ξ Why
hast thou given me seven hills and such a population
as a small supply cannot nourish? Happier Ι, had
my power been less, Better to have put up with
Samnium and Veii; in narrower bonds I passed

and the walls of poor Ancus, Enough for me then
would be the ploughlands of Etruria and Campania,
the farms of Cincinnatus and Curius , and at his
country’s prayer the rustic dictator 1 would bring
his home-grown wheat.

“ What am I to do now? Gildo holds Libya,
another 2 Egypt 3 while I, who subdued land and sea
with my strong arm, am left to perish. Veteran of so
many warS, can I claim no reward in mine old age ?
Ye gods in whose despite, it seemS, I increased‚ now

Cybele, if ever of thine own free will thou wert
carried over the sea and in exchange for Mount Ida
tookest the hills of Rome and didst bathe thy Phrygian
lions in Almo's more favoured stream, move now thy
son³ with a mother’s entreatieS. But if the fates forbid
and our first founder was misled by augury untrue‚
o'erwhelm me at least in some different ruin, and
change the nature of my punishment. Let Porsenna
bring back the Tarquins ; let Allia renew her bloody
battle. Let me fall rather into the hands of cruel
