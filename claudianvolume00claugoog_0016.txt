INTRODUCTION

this just murder was Claudian’s her0, Stilicho the ,

Vandal.

, Stilicho, who had been one of Theodosius’ generaIS,
had been put in command of the troops sent to
oppose Alaric, the Visigoth, when the latter had
broken away from his allegiance to Rome and was
spreading devastation throughout Thrace, Macedonia
and Thessaly. He was successful in his campaign,
but, upon his marching south into Greece, in order
to rid that country also of its Gothic invaderS, he was
forbidden by Rufinus to advance any farther. There
can be little doubt that the murder of Rufinus was
Stilicho’s answer.

In spite of a subsequent victory over Alaric near
Elis in the year 397, Stilicho’s success can have been
but a partial one, for we find the Visigoth general
occupying the post of Master of the Soldiery in
Illyricum, the withholding of which office had been
the main cause of his defection. Possibly, too, the
revolt of Gildo in Africa had something to do with
the unsatisfactory termination of the Visigothic war.
It is interesting to observe the dependence of Italy
on African corn, a dependence of which in the first
century of the Christian era Vespasian, and right
at the end of the second the pretender Pescennius
Niger, threatened to make use. If we can credit
the details of Claudian’s poem on the war (No. xv.),
Rome was very shortly reduced to a state of semi-
starvation by Gildo’s holding up of the corn fleet,
and, but for Stilicho ’s prompt action in sending
Gildo’s own brother, Mascezel, to put down the
rebellion, the situation might have become even
more critical. The poet, it may be remarked, was
in an awkward position with regard to the war for,
