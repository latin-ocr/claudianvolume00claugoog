oN STILcho’s CONSULSHIP (ω. 400)
BOOK 1
(XXI)

Ceaseless are the blessings the gods shower with
full bounty upon Rome, crowning success with new
successeS. Scarce had the happy songs of marriage
ceased to echo in the palace when the defeat of
Gildo brought material for a hymn of triumph.
Hard upon the garlands of passionate love followed

, the crown of laurel, so that the emperor won alike

the name of husband and the fame of conqueror.
After the war in Africa eastern sedition waned3
the Orient once. more was laid low and, guarded
by the consul Stilich0, the axes rose in triumph.
In due order are vows fulfilled. Should I hope to
roll into one poem all my lofty themeS‚ more easily
, should Ι pile Pelion on frozen Ossa. Were I silent
anent a part, what I leave unsung will prove the
greater. Am I to recall his deeds of old and earliest,
manhood? His present deeds lure away my mind.
Am I to tell of his justice? His military glory
outshines it. Shall Ι mention his prowess in war?
He has done more in peace. Shall I relate how
Latium flourisheS, how Africa has returned to her
allegiance and service, how Spain knows no more
