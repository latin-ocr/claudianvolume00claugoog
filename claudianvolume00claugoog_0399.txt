For truly since man inhabited this globe never
has one mortal been granted all earth's blessings
without alloy. This man's face is fair but his char-
acter is evil; another has a beauteous soul but an
ugly body. One is renowned in war but makes
peace hideous with his viceS. This man is happy in
his ’ public but unhappy in his private life. Each
takes a part ; each owes his fame to some one gift,
to bodily beauty‚ to martial proweSS‚ to strength,
to uprightness of life, to knowledge of law, to
his offspring and a virtuous wife. To all men else
blessings come scattered‚ to thee they flow com-
nhincgledghandhgrilfts that separately make happy are

loyalty to Valens never led to battle those yellow-
haired companieS‚ yet to be the father of Stilicho
would have spread abroad his fame. Ever from thy
cradle did thy soul aspire, and in the tender years
of childhood shone forth the signs of loftier estate.
Lofty in spirit and eager‚ nothing paltry didst thou
essay3 never didst thou haunt any rich man’s
doorstep 3 thy speech was such as to befit thy future
dignitieS. A mark wert thou even then for all
eyeS‚ even then an object of reverence3 the fiery
brightness of thy noble countenance‚ the very mould
