Suidas and the lines of Sidonius Apollinaris,1 which
clearly refer to Claudian and which give Canopus as
the place of his birth. (Canopus is almost certainly
to be taken as synonymous with Egypt.) But besides
these two statements we have only to look at his
interest in things Egyptian, ag. his, poems on the
Nile, the Phoenix, etc„ at such passages as his
account of the rites at Memphis,2 at such phrases as
‘⁸ nostro cognite Nilo,'’ ³ to see that the poet is an
Egyptian himself. Itis probable that, whether or not
he spent all his early life in Egypt, Claudian did not
visit Rome until 394. We know from his own state-
ment 4 that his first essays in literature were all of
them written in Greek and that it was not until the
year 395 that he started to write Latin. It is not
unlikely, therefore, that his change of country and
of literary language were more or less contempo-
raneouS, and it is highly probable that he was in
Rome before J anuary 3, 395, on which day his
friends the Anicii (Probinus and Olybrius) entered

Claudian seems to have betaken himself to the court
at Milan, and it is from there that he sends letters
to Probinus and OlybriuS.⁶ Here the poet seems to
have stayed for five yearS, and here he seems to
