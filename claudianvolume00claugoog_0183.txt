AGAINST EUTROPIUS, Ι

See what manner of man they seek to connect with
the annals of Rome ε the very eunuchs were ashamed
of him. At first of no account, he lay hid, the most
unknown unit of an unregarded throng, till thanks
to the mad folly of Abundantius 1 (who brought
ruin on the empire of the East and, ere that, upon
himself) he was advanced from the most menial
office to the highest honours. What a happy dis-
pensation of providence it is that in this world the
results of ill counsel fall first upon its instigators!
Thus the seer who advised Busiris to placate the
Thunderer's wrath, what time Nile’s flood had long
run dry, with a stranger’s blood himself first stained
that tyrant's altar with his own and fell a victim
of the horrid sacrifice he had advised. Thus he who
made the brazen bull and devised that new form of
torture, casting the deadly bronze as an instrument
of torment, was (at the bidding of the Sicilian tyrant)
the first to make trial of the unhanselled image,
and to teach his own bull to roar. So with Eutropius ε
011 no man’s goods did he sooner seize than on those
of him by whom he had been raised to power;
none did he drive sooner into exile and thus, by the
condemnation of his patron, was to thank for one
righteous action.

When this half-man, worn out with age, had
been raised to that pinnacle of glory for which 'he
never would have dared to pray, of which never to
dream 3 when he had seen law at his feet, the heads
of the nobility inclined before him, and fortune heap·
ing such gifts upon one whose only hope and prayer
had been to gain his freedom, he straightway forgot

and ,banished three years later to Pityus, thanks to the
machinations of Eutropius.
