PANEGYRIC
(VII)

Let the consular fasces of Romulus open a third
year, and for the third time let the warlike procession
accompany thy curule litter. More festal in array
be the coming year, and let purple, folded in Gabine 1
guise, be proudly enriched with gems of Hydaspes ;
let the cloak of peace succeed the arms of war3
let the lictor guard the consul's tent and the Latin
axes return to the standardS.² And do thou,
Honorius, who with thy brother, lord of the East,
governest with equal care a world that was once thy
sire’s, go thy way with favourable omens and order
the sun’s new course, thyself heaven’s hope and
desire, palace-nurtured even from life’s threshold,
to whom the camp, gleaming with drawn swordS,
gave schooling among the laurels of victory. Thy
towering fortune has never known the condition of a
private citizen 3 when thou wast born thou wast born
a king. Power which was thine by birth received
thee, a precious pledge, amid the purple; soldiers
bearing victorious standards inaugurated thy birth
and set thy cradle in the midst of arms, When
thou wast born fierce Germany trembled along

² Claudian suggests the unitIng of civil and military
‘power in the hands of Honorius·
