THE FIRST BOOK AGAINST RUFINUS

tainedst with th shoulders the tottering world in
its threatened gall? The gods gave thee to us
as they show a welcome star to frightened mariners
whose weary bark is buffeted with storms of wind
and wave and drifts with blind course now that
her steersman is beaten. PerseuS, descendant of
InachuS, 1s said to have overcome N eptune s monsters
in the Red Sea, but he was helped by his wings3
no wing bore thee aloft : Perseus was armed with
the Gorgons' head that turneth all to stone3 the
snaky locks of Medusa protected not thee. His
motive was but the love of a chained girl, thine the
salvation of Rome. The days of old are surpassed;
let them keep silence and cease to compare Hercules’
labours with thine. 'Twas but one wood that
sheltered the lion of Cleonae, the savage boar's
tusks laid ,waste a single Arcadian vale, and thou,
rebel AntaeuS, holding thy mother earth in thine
embrace, ‘didst no, hurt beyond the borders of Africa.
Crete alone re-,echoed to the bellowings of the fire-
breathing bull, and the green hydra beleaguered no
more than Lerna’s lake. But this monster Rufinus
terrified not one lake nor one island: whatsoever
lives beneath the Roman rule, from distant Spain
to Ganges’ stream, was in fear of him. N either
triple Geryon nor Hell' s fierce janitor can vie with
him nor could the conjoined terrors of powerful
Hydra, ravenous Scylla, and fiery Chimaera.

Long hung the contest 111 suspense, but the struggle
betwixt vice and virtue was ill— matched 111 character.
Rufinus threatens slaughter, thou stayest his hand3
he robs the rich, thou givest back to the poor· , he
overthroWS, thou restorest3 he sets wars afoot, thou
winnest them. As a pestilence, growing from day
