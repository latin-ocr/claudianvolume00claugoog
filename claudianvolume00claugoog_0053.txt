PANEGYRIC ΟΝ PROBINUS AND OLYBRIUS

flame. These shall direct men’s sails and vouchsafe
those breezes whereby the sailor shall guide his
bark o’er the calm ocean. Let us now pour libation
to the new gods and ease our hearts with copious
draughts of nectar. NaiadS, now spread your snowy
bandS‚wreath every brow with violetS. Let the woods
bring forth honey and the drunken river roll, its
waters changed to wine 3 let the watering streams
that vein the fields give off the scent of balsam spice.
Let one run and invite to the feast and banquet- <
board all the rivers of our land, even all that wander
beneath the mountains of Italy and drink as their
portion the Alpine snOWS‚ swift Vulturnus and Nar
infected with ill-smelling sulphur, Ufens whose
meanderings delay his course and Eridanus into
whose waters Phaethon fell headlong3 Liris who
laves Marica's golden oak groves and Galaesus
who tempers the fields of Sparta’s colony Tarentum.
This day shall always be held in honour and observed
by our rivers and its anniversary ever celebrated
with rich feasting8.''

So spake he, and the Nymphs, obeying their sire’s
behest, made ready the rooms for the banquet, and
the watery palace‚ ablaze with gleaming purple,
shone with jewelled tableS.

O happy months to bear these brothers’ name!
O year blessed to own such a pair as overlordS, begin
thou to turn the laborious wheel of Phoebus’ four-
fold circle. First let thy winter pursue its course,
sans numbing cold, not clothed in white snow
nor torn by rough blasts, but warmed with the
south wind’s breath ε next, be thy spring calm
from the outset and let the limpid west wind’s
gentler breeze flood thy meads with yellow flowerS.
