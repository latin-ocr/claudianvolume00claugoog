AGAINST EUTROPIUS, I

“ What need of further words ? Why, Stilicho, dost
thou delay to conquer because ashamed to fight?
Knowest thou not that the viler a foe the greater
the rej oicing at his overthrow? His defeat of the
pirates extended the fame of great Pompey; his
victory in the Servile War gave an added glory to
Crassus· Thou acceptest my charge: I recognize
the clamour that terrified the East and drove Gildo
and his Moors to their destruction. Why sound the
trump of war ? No need to attack him with javelin
or spear. At the crack of the whip will be bowed
the back that has felt its blows. Even so when
after many years the Scythian army came back
from the wars and was met on the confines of its
native land by the usurping crowd of slaves who
sought to keep their returning masters from their
country 3 with displayed whips they routed the armed
ranks ; back from its enterprise the familiar terror
drove the servile mob, and at threat of the lash the
bondsman’s sword grew dull.''
