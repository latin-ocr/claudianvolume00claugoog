INTRODUCTION

ManliuS‚ which is certainly brighter than the others)
are uniformly dull, but the poems on Rufinus and
Eutropius are, though doubtless in the worst of
taste, at least in parts amusing.

Claudian’s faults are easy to find. He mistook
memory for inspiration and so is often wordy and
tediouS, as for instance in his three poems on Stilicho's
consulship.1 Worse than this he is frequently ob-
scure and involved—witness his seven poems on the
drop of water contained within the rock crystal.2
The besetting sin, toO, of almost all post-Virgilian
Roman poets‚ Ι mean a “ conceited ” frigidity, is one
into which he is particularly liable to fall. Examples
are almost too numerous to cite but the following
are typical: “ nusquam totiensque sepultus '’ ³ of
the body of RufinuS‚ torn limb from limb by the
infuriated soldiery3 ‘⁴ caudamque in puppe re-
torquens Ad proram iacet usque leo '' ‘² of one of
the animals brought from Africa for the games at
Stilicho's triumph3 “ saevusque Damastor, Ad de-
pellendos iaculum cum quaereret hosteS, Germani
rigidum misit pro rupe cadaver '' 5 of the* giant
Pallas turned to stone by the Gorgon's head on
Minerva’s shield. Consider‚ t00, the remarkable

¹ Honourable exception should be made of xxi. 291 et sqq.
—one of the best and most sincere things Claudian ever
wro e.

² It is worth observing that not infrequently Claudian is
making “ tentamina,'' or writin alternative lines ε ay.
Carm. min. corp. vii. 1 and 2, an almost certainly the four
lines of id. vi. v. is quite likely ‘⁴ a trial ’⁹ for some such
passage as xv. 523.
