PANEGYRIO ΟΝ ΤΗΕ FOURTH CONSULSHIP

’ (vm)

Once more the year opens under royal auspices
and enjoys in fuller pride its famous prince3 not
brooking to linger around private thresholds the
returning fasces rejoice in Caesar’s consulship
Seest thou how the armed chiefs and mighty judges
don the raiment of senators? and the soldiers
step forth in garb of peaceful hue worn Gabine 1
wise‚ and laying aside for a season the standards
of war follow the banner of Quirinus, The eagles
give way to the lictorS, the smiling soldier wears
the toga of peace and the senate-house casts
its brilliance in the midst of the camp. Bellona
herself, surrounded by a noble band of senatorS,
puts on the consul’s gown and lays by her shield and
helmet in order to harness the sacred curule chair to
her shoulderS. Think it no shame, Gradivus, to bear
the laurel-crowned axes in a hand of peace and to
exchange thy shining breastplate for the Latin
toga while thine iron chariot remains unused and
thy steeds disport them in the pastures of Eridanus·

Not unworthy of reverence nor but newly
acquainted with war is the family of Trajan and that
Spanish house which has showered diadems upon
the world. No common stream was held worthy
