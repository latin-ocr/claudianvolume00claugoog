y THE FOURTH CONSULSHIP OF HONORIUS
l Heaven grant thou mayest be our perpetual consul
and outnumber Marius ¹ and old Augustus, Happy
universe that shall see the first down creep over thy
cheekS‚ and the wedding-night that shall lead forth
for thee the festal torcheS. Who shall be consecrated
to such a couch3 who, glorious in purple, shall
ffiS,tabqugen,ht(l›l the empgages pli* suAEh abhusbafnd?
a r1esa come e eau eroso
many godS, dowered with every land ancgl the whole
sea? How gloriously shall the nuptial song be
borne at once to farthest East and West! Ο may
it be mine to sing ⁸thy marriage-hymn, mine pre-
sently to hail thee father! The time will come
when, thou victorious beyond the mouths of the
Rhine, and thy brother Arcadius laden with the
spoil of captured Babylon, ye shall endow the year
with yet more glorious majesty; when the long-
haired Suebian shall bear the arms of Rome and
the distant Bactrian tremble beneath the rule of
thyself and thy brother.
