AGAINST EUTROPIUS, I κ

10 swell out his pendulous cheeks and seigns a heavy
panting 3 his lousy head dust-sprinkled and his face
bleached whiter by the sun, he sobs out some
pitiful complaint with voice -more effeminate 111311
effeminacy's sels 311(1 16113 01 11311163. Ι11 tremulous
tones he calls his sister to witness that he has spent
his strength 101· his country’ 3 1166(1; 11131 116 yields
to envy and cannot stand up against the storms of
jealousy and prays to 116 drowned in the foaming
3633. Would God his prayer had been granted!
Thus. speaking, he wipes away the silly 16313,

sig‘hing and sobbing between each word3 like a.
withered old dame travelled 131 10 visit 1161 3011 ’3
daughter— scarce seated aweary and already she
asks for wine.

Why busy thy foul 3611 with wars ? Why attempt
battle on the bloody field? ’Tis to the arts of that
other Minerva thou shouldst apply thyself. The
distaff, not the dart should be thine 3 thine to spin
the thread, and, cunning craftsman that thou art,
to urge on the spinning-maids ‘when lazy3 thine
to wind the snowy wool for thy mistress’ weaving.
Or, wouldst thou be a devotee, let Cybele, not MarS,
be the object of thy worship. Learn to imitate the
madness of the Corybantes to the accompaniment
01 rolling drums. Thou mayest carry cymbaIS,
pierce thy breast with the sacred pine, and with
Phrygian knife destroy what yet is left of thy
virility. Leave arms to men. Why seek to divide
the two empires and embroil loving brothers in
strife? Madman‚ remember thy former trade3
’twere more fitting thou shouldst endeavour to
reconcile them.

It is for deeds like this that Eutropius demands
