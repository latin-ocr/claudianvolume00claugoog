crevices of their home, their beloved pumice—stone
cave, swarming over the honeycombs therein,

There is a place where the unhallowed rivers of
Cocytus and Phlegethon mingle their dread streams
of tears and fire. Between the rivers yet nearer to

that of Phlegethon there juts a tower stiff with ’

solid adamant that bathes its left side in the flames 3

the king, now stripped of his empty title. Seen
afar on his lofty throne the judge Minos examines
the charges and separates the wicked from the

his garrulity. When for thrice a thousand years he
had forced these through countless diverse shapeS,
he sends them back once more to the beginnings of
human form purged at last with Lethe’s stream.
