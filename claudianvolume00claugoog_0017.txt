though the real credit of victory was clearly due to
Mascezel (cf. xv. 380 et sqq.), he nevertheless wished
to attribute it to his hero Stilich0, and, as Stilicho
had Mascezel executed 1 later in that same year
(Gildo had been defeated at Tabraca J uly 31, 398),
he prudently did not write, or perhaps suppressed,
Book II.

Stilich0, who had married Serena, niece and adop-
- tive daughter of TheodosiuS, still further secured his
position by giving his daughter, Maria, in marriage
to the young Emperor Honorius in the year 398.

, This‘ ‘fa-ther --1n -law and son· in- -law of an emperor,'

as Claudian 1s never wearied of calling him, did the
country of his adoption a signal service by the defeat
at Pollentia on Easter Day (April 6), 402, of Alaric,
wh0, for reasons of which we really know nothing,
had again proved unfaithful to Rome and had invaded
and laid waste Italy· 1n the winter of 401-402.

The battle of Pollentia was the last important event
in Claudian' s lifetime. He seems to have died in
404, four years before the murder of Stilicho by the
jealous Honorius and six before the sack of Rome
by Alaric——a disaster which Stilicho2 alone, perhapS,
might have averted.

So much for the historical background of the
life of the poet. Of the details of his career we
are not well informed. Something, indeed, we
can gather from the pages of the poet himself,
though it is not much, but besides this we have
to guide us only Hesychius of Miletus’ short
