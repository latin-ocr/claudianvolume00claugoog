AGAINST EUTROPIUS, I

consul, and a man about to grant to others a liberty
which he has not yet himself won. He mounts the
lofty platform and amid a torrent of self- laudation
boasts of a prophetie dream he had in Egypt 1 and
of the defeat of tyrants which he foretold. No
doubt the goddess of war stayed her avenging hand
and waited till that emasculate TiresiaS, that
unmanned MelampuS‚ could crawl back with oracles
culled from farthest Nile.

Loud sang the prophetie birds in warning. The
year shuddered at the thought of bearing Eutropius’
name, and J anus proclaimed the madness of the
6110166 from his two mouthS, forbidding a eunuch
to have access to his annaIS. Had a woman assumed
the fasces, though this were illegal it were neverthe-
less less disgraceful. Women bear sway among the
Medes and swift Sabaeans; half barbary 1s governed
by martial queenS. We know of no people who
endure a eunuch’ s rule. Worship is paid to Pallas,
Phoebe, Vesta, CereS, Cybele, J uno and Latona,
have we ever seen a temple built or altars raised to
a eunuch god ? From among women are priestesses
chosen ς Phoebus enters into their hearts ; through
their voices the Delphian oracle speaks3 none but
the Vestal Virgins approach the shrine of Troj an
Minerva and tend her flame: eunuchs have never
deserved the fillet and are always unholy. A woman
is born that she may bear children and perpetuate
the human 1366 ; the tribe of eunuchs was made for
servitudes Hippolyte fell but by the arrow of
Hercules ; the Greeks fied before Penthesilea’s
axe; Carthage, far-famed citadel, proud Babylon
with her hundred gateS‚ are both said to have been
built by a woman’s hand. What noble deed did
