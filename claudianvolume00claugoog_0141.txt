THE WAR AGAINST GILDo, 1'

Pyrrhus 3 abandon me to the fury of the Senones
or the flames of Brennus„ Welcome all this rather
than to starve ! ’⁹ .

So spake she, and upwelling tears choked her voice.
Venus, mother of Aeneas, wept‚ and MarS, father of
Romulus and Minerva, mindful of Vesta's sacred
charge.1 Nor Cybele nor J uno stood with dry eyes,
The heroes mourn and all the gods whose worship
Rome received from without or herself inaugurated.
And now began the heart of Jove to soften. With
hand outstretched he was checking the murmurings of
the gods when, shaking heaven with distraught crieS,
Africa, her cheeks torn, appeared in the distance

advancing amid the starS. Torn was her raiment, ’

scattered her crown of corn. Her head was wounded
and the ivory comb that secured her hair hung
loose and broken. She rushed into Heaven’s
halls shouting thus: “ Great Jove, why delayest‘
thou to loose the bonds of sea, to break its
decree and hurl thy brother 2 in wrath against
the land? May I be the first to be overwhelmed.
Welcome the broken waters from Pachynus’ cape ;
sink my cities in the freed Syrtes, If so be fate
cannot rid me of Gildo, rid Gildo of me. Happier
that region of Libya that defends itself by means
of its own excessive heat and thus knows not the
irksome rule of so savage a tyrant. Let the torrid
zone spread. Let the midmost path of the scorching
sky burn me also. Better I lay a desert nor ever
suffered the plough. Let the dust-snake lord it in
a cornless land and the thirsty earth give birth to
nought but vipers. What avails me a healthy
climate, a milder air? My fruitfulness is but for

² ia. Neptune.
