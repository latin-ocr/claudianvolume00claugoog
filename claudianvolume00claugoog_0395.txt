THE CONSULSHIP OF MANLIUS

pyramids that grow with swift entwining of their
bodieS, to the summit of which pyramid rushes
a boy fastened by a thong, a boy who, attached
there by the foot or leg, executes a step-dance
suspended in the air. Let the counterweights be
removed and the mobile crane descend, lowering on
to the lofty stage men wh0‚ wheeling chorus-wise,
scatter flames3 let Vulcan forge balls of fire to roll
innocuously across the boardS, let the flames appear
to play about the sham beams of the scenery and a
tame conflagration‚ never allowed to rest, wander
among the untouched towerS. Let ships meet in
mimic warfare on an improvised ocean and the
flooded waters be lashed to foam by singing oarsmen.
“ As consul at once and stateliest master, upborne
by a twofold fame, let Manlius go forth among the
peopleS, read in his own books and in our calendarS.
May the sire’s example be followed by the son 1
and handed on to a grandson, nor these first fasces
ever lack succession. May his race pass on purple-
elad, may the generations, each to each, hand on the
axeS‚ and obedient to the ordinance of fate, Manlius
after Manlius add one more consul to the tale.''
