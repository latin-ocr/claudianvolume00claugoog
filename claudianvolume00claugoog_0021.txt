fourth consulship of Honorius and the poems cele-
brating the marriage of the emperor to Stilicho’ s
daughter, Maria. We have already seen that the
Gildo episode and Claudian' s poem on that subject
are to be attributed to this same year.

The consuls for the year 399 were both, in different
wayS, considered worthy of the poet' s pen. Perhaps
the most savage of all his poems was directed against
Eutropius, the eunuch chamberlain, whose claim to
the consulship the West never recognized,l while a
Panegyric on Flavius Manlius Theodorus made
amends for an abusive epigram which the usually
more politic Claudian had previously levelled at
him. 2

At the end of 399, or possibly at the beginning of
400, Claudian returned to Rome ³ where, probably
in February,‘² he recited his poem on the consulship
of Stilicho 3 and we have no reason for supposing
that the poet left the capital from this time on until
his departure for his ill-starred journey four years
later. In the year 402,5 as has already been men-

Claudian recited his poem on the Gothic war some-
