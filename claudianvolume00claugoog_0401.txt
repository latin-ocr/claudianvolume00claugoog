ΟΝ STILICHO'S CONSULSHIP, Ι

of thy limbs‚ greater even than poets feign of
demi-godS‚ marked thee out for a leader of men.
Whithersoever thy proud form went in the city
thou didst see men rise and give place to thee3
yet thou wast then but a soldier. The silent suffrage
of the people had already offered thee all the honours
the court was soon to owe.

Scarce hadst thou reached man ’s estate when thou
wast sent to negotiate peace with Assyria 1· 3 to
make a treaty with so great a people was the charge ζ
entrusted to thy youth. Crossing the Tigris and
the deep Euphrates thou cam 'st to Babylon. The
grave lords of Parthia looked at thee in amaze and
the quiver- bearing mob burned with desire to
behold, while the daughters of Persia gazing on their
beauteous guest sighed out their hidden love. The
peace is sworn at altars sweet with the fragrance of
incense and the harvests of Saba. Fire is brought
forth from the innermost sanctuary and the Magi
sacrifice heifers according to the Chaldean ritual.
The king himself dips the jewelled bowl of sacrifice
and swears by the mysteries of Bel and by Mithras
who guides the errant stars of heaven. Whenever
they made thee sharer of their hunting, whose
sword struck down the lion in close combat before
that of Stilicho, whose arrow pierced the striped tiger
afar before thine ? When thou didst guide the easy
rein the Mede gave way to thee, and the Parthian
marvelled at the bow thou didst discharge in flight.

Meanwhile a maiden of years full ripe for marriage
troubled a father's heart, and the emperor doubted
whom to select as her husband and as future ruler
of the world3 right anxiously did he search east
and west for a son- in- -law worthy of being wedded
