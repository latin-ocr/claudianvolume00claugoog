> THE SECOND BOOK AGAINST RUFINUS

Silence, ye clarions3 men, forbear to shoot. The
foe is at hand, spare him ; ’tis Rufinus’ command.’'
At these words an unanimous roar went up from
all the companies. With less din are the cliffs of
Ceraunia buffeted by the Italian sea or the thunders
evoked from the western winds' wet stom-clouds.
They will not separate, and demand the battle of which
they have been defrauded. East and west claim the
leadership of that illustrious chief. It is a contest
of affection3 insubordination that none can blame
threatens to sap the loyalty of both armies who thus
utter their common complaint: “ Who is it robs us
of our drawn swords ? Who strikes the lance from our
hand and bids us unstring the bent bow ? Who
dares dictate to an army under arms ? Valour once
roused knows no abatement. Spears thirsting for
barbarian blood cast themselves from out our hands ;
our headlong blades force our vengeful arms to follow
them ; our very scabbards refuse to sheath an
unblooded sword. I will not bear it. Shall the Getae
ever profit by our dissension ? Behold once more the
shadow of civil war. Why dost thou seek to separate
armies whose blood is one, standards of immemorial
alliance ? We are a body one and indivisible. T hee
will we follow whithersoever thou goest3 thee will
we accompany even as far as Thule lying icebound

beneath the pole- s-tar, or to the burning sands of

Libya. Should thy path be by the waters of Ind,
or the bays of the Red Sea, 1 I would go drink
Hydaspes' golden stream. Shouldst thou bid me
fare south and search out the hidden sources of the
stripling Nile, I would leave behind me the world
