INTRODUCTION

Maximus was defeated by him at Aquileia and
put to death, while Arbogast recovered Gaul by
means of an almost bloodless campaign (388).

The next scene in the drama is the murder at
Vienne on May 15, 392, of the feeble Valentinian at
the instigation of Arbogast. Arbogast’s triumph waS,
however, short-lived. Not daring himself, a Frank,
to assume the purple he invested therewith his
secretary‚ the Roman EugeniuS, intending to govern
the West with Eugenius as a mere figure-head.
Once more, and now for the last time, Theodosius
‘saved the cause of legitimacy by defeating Eugenius‘
at the battle of the Frigidus1 in September 394.
Eugenius was executed but Arbogast made good his
escape, only to fall a few weeks later by his own hand.

Theodosius himself died on J anuary 17, 395, leaving
his two sonS, Arcadius and Honorius, emperors of
the East and West respectively. Arcadius was but
a tool in the hands of his praetorian prefect, RufinuS,
whose character is drawn with such venomous
ferocity in Claudian’s two poems. Almost equally
powerful and scarcely less corrupt seems to have
been that other victim of Claudian's splenetic verseS,
the eunuch chamberlain Eutropius , who became
consul in the year 399. Both these men suffered a
violent end ι Eutropius, in spite of the pleadings of
S. John Chrysostom, was put to death by GainaS,
the commander of the Gothic troops in the East3
Rufinus was torn to pieces in the presence of Arcadius
himself by his Eastern troops, 2 The instigator of
