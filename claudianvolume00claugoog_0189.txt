AGAINST EUTROPIUS, I

drunken with richeS, makes sport of wretched law
and the affairs of men. A eunuch is judge. Why
now wonder that he is consul? Whatever he does
is a prlodigiy.d §affletannals of thle law show calses

ever witnessed a eunuch’s jurisdiction {ryThat
nought might remain undisgraced, nought un·-
attempted, he even makes him ready to outrage
armS‚ heaps portent on portent and wanton folly
seeks to outdo itself. Mars blushed, Bellona scoffed
and turned her from the disgrace of the East whene’er
with arrows strung and flashing quiver the aged
Amazon practises battle or hurries back as arbiter
of peace and war to hold parley with the Getae.
Our enemies rejoiced at the sight and felt that at
last we were lacking in men. Towns were set ablaze ;
walls offered no security. The countryside was
ravaged and brought to ruin. Mid-ocean alone
gave hope. Women of Cappadocia were driven into
captivity across the river Phasis3 stolen from the
stalls of their homesteadS, the captive herds drink
the snowy streams of Caucasus, and the flocks
exchange the pastures of Mount Argaeus ¹ for the
woods of Scythia. Beyond the Cimmerian marsheS,
defence of the Tauric tribeS, the youth of Syria are
slaves, Too vast for the fierce barbarians are the
spoils ; glutted with booty they turn to slaughter.
Yet Eutropius (can a slave, an effeminate, feel

Eutropius returns in triumph. There follow com-
panies of foot, squadrons like their general, maniples
of eunuchS, an army worthy Priapus' standardS.
His creatures meet him and embrace their saviour
on his return.2 Great is his sels-esteem3 he struggles
