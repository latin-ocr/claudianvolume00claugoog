THE SECOND BOOK AGAINST RUFINUS

So then while he settles these suitS, dread business
of that infernal court, while he examines in due order
the criminals of old, he marks afar RufinuS, scans
him with a stern scrutiny and speaks, shaking his
throne to its foundation. “ Hither, RufinuS‚ scourge
of the world, bottomless sink of gold who wouldst
dare aught for money ; hither conscienceless seller
of justice (that crime of crimes), faithless cause of
that northern war whose thousand slaughtered
victims now throng Hell’s narrow entry and weigh
down Charon's crowded barque. Madman, why deny
what all know? The foul stains of wickedness are
branded upon thy heart, thy crimes have made
their impress on thy spirit and thy sins cannot be
hid. Right glad I am to sentence thee to every
kind of punishment. O'er thee shall hang the
threatening rock the moment of whose fall thou
knowest not. The circling wheel shall rack thee.
Thy lips the stream’s waves shall flee, thirst shall
parch thee to whose chin its elusive waters mount.
The vulture shall leave his former prey and feast for
ever on thy heart. And yet all these, RufinuS,
whom the like punishments torment, how paltry
their wickedness compared with thine! Did bold
Salmoneus' thunderbolt or Tantalus’ tongue ever
do like wrong or Tityos so offend with his mad
love? J oin all their crimes together yet wilt thou
surpass them. What sufficient atonement can be
found for such wickedness? What to match thy
sum of crimes whose single misdeeds outmatch
all punishment? Shades, remove from this our
ghostly company that presence that disgraces it.
To have seen once is enough. Have mercy now
on our eyeS, and cleanse the realm of Dis. Drive
