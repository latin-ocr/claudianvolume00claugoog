THE FOURTH coNsULsHIP oF HONomUs

the 3331113; there gleams the amethyst and the
glint of Spanish gold makes the dark-blue sapphire
show duller with its hidden fires. Nor in the weaving
of such a robe was unadorned beauty enough 3 the
work of the needle increases its value, thread of
gold and silver glows therefrom3 many an agate
adorns the embroidered robeS‚ and pearls of Ocean
breathe 111 varied pattern. What bold hand, what
distaff had skill enough to render supple elements
so hard ? What loom so cunning as to weave jewels
into close-textured eloth? Wh0, searching out the
uncharted pools of hot Eastern 3333, despoiled the
bosom of Tethys? Who dared seek o’er burning
sands rich growth of coral? Who could broider
precious stones on scarlet and so mingle the shining ⁷
glories of the Red Sea and of Phoenicia's waters?
Tyre lent her dyeS, China her silks‚ Hydaspes his

car, guiding the necks of Hyrcanian tigers with ivory
yoke 3 around him satyrs and wild-haired Maenads
fetter Indians with triumphant ivy, while drunken
Ganges twines his hair with the vine tendril.
Already shouts of joy and of good omen resound
about the consul’s throne to welcome this thy fourth
opening of Rome’s year. Liberty enacts her wonted
ceremonies 3 Law observes the custom dating back
to Vindex 1 whereby 3 slave freed from his master’s
service is introduced into thy presence and thence
