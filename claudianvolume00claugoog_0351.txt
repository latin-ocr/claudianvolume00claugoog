THE FOURTH CONSULSHIP OF HONORIUS

setting sun ; what storm-wind frets the Moon so that
discoloured she uplifts an angry face. Behold now,
great father, in whatsoever part of heaven thou
shinest, be it the southern arch or the cold con-
stellation of the Plough that has won the honour of
thy presence ; see, thy prayer has been answered3

Sygambri abased their flaxen locks and the Franks
cast themselves upon the ground and sued with ·
trembling voice for pardon. Germany swears allegi-
ance to the absent Honorius and addresses her sup-
pliant prayers to him. Fierce Bastarnae were there
and the Bructeri who dwell in the Hercynian forest.
The Cimbrians left their broad marsh-landS, the tall
Cherusci came from the river Elbe. Stilicho listens
