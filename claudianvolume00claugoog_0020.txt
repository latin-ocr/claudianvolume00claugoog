INTRODUCTION

have won for himself a position of some importance.
As we see from the inscription quoted above, he
became vir clarissimus, tribunus et notarim, and, as he
does not continue further along the road of honours
(does not, for instance, become a vir spectabilis) we
must suppose that he served in some capacity on
Stilicho’s private staff. No doubt he became a sort
of poet laureate.

It is probable that the ‘⁴ De raptu ” was written
during the first two years of his sojourn at the court
of Milan. The poem is dedicated, or addressed, to
FlorentinuS,1 who was prae ectus urbi from August
395 to the end of 397 when e fell into disgrace with
Stilicho. It is to this circumstance that we are to
attribute the unfinished state of Claudian's poem.

The Emperor Honorius became consul for the
third time on J anuary 3, 396, and on this occasion
Claudian read his Panegyric in the emperor’s pres-
enee.2

Some five weeks before this event another of
greater importance had occurred in the East. This
was the murder of RufinuS, the praetorian prefect,
amid the circumstances that have been related
above. The date of the composition of Claudian’s
two poems “ In Rufinum '' is certainly to be placed
within the years 395-397, and the mention of a
“ tenuem moram ” 3 makes it probable that Book ΙΙ.
was written considerably later than Book I.; the
references, moreover‚ in the Preface to Book ΙΙ. to
a victory of Stilicho clearly point to that general’s
defeat of the Goths near Elis in 397.

To the year 398 belong the Panegyric on the
