THE WAR AGAINST GILDO, I

East quarrel with those of the West ? Can Gildo's
salvation be fit guerdon for this mad rivalry ? Great
no doubt are his virtues, great should be the price

paid to preserve them and such his merits as to ,

banish affection in a brother. Look yon, though I,
thy sire, willed it not, civil war raged ; the fortunes of
Rome stood on a razor’s edge. Was there a distant
king of Armenia, an unknown monarch by Maeotis'
shore but sent aid to mine enterprises? The Getae
gave me succour, the Geloni came to my assistance.
Gildo alone sent not a man, not 3 ship, but waited
the issue in wavering loyalty. Had he sought the
confronting host as an open foe my wrath had been
less bitter. He stood apart on Fortune’s watch-
tower and, withdrawn from the throng‚ weighed this
side against that,meaning to let the event decide him,
dependent upon the turn things might take and ready
to embrace the side of the victor. His fortune hung in
the balance as well as his intention. Had I not been
hurried to heaven by the impatient stars I would have
followed the example of Tullus Hostilius and dragged
the impious wretch limb from limb fastened to
chariots driven different ways through thorn bushes.1
Up to this time he has owed obedience to thy brother,
now behold he spurns his commandS. After thy
father’s and thy brother's fate art thou ready to
trust thyself to such a villain ? Is thine answer that
he maketh great return and hath brought over many
cities to thine allegiance ? Shall honour, then, give
place to utility ? Can gain render treachery welcome ?
I make no mention of his cruel betrayal of thy brother 3
of his fickle nature ; were a traitor to bring safety
even when at peril's height death threatened, never
shall hc win gratitude. When our life is saved
