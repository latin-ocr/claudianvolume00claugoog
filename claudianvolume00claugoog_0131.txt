THE WAR AGAINST GILDO1
BOOK I

(XV)

The kingdom of the south is restored to our empne,
the sky of that other hemisphere is once more
brought into subjection. East and West live in
amity and concord beneath the sway of one ruler.
We have joined Europe again to Africa, and un-
swerving singleness of purpose unites the brother
emperorS. The would-be third participant of empire
has fallen before the prowess of Honorius the son
—that one victory that failed to grace the arms of
TheodosiuS, the father. Still is my mind troubled
and admits not the universal joy for very amazement,
⁴ nor can believe the fulfilment of its heartfelt prayerS.
Not yet had the army landed upon Africa’s 2 coasts
when Gildo yielded to defeat. No difficulties
delayed our victorious armS‚ neither length of march
nor intervening ocean. One and the same word ’
brings news of the conflict, the flight, the capture of
Gildo. The news of victory outstripped the news of
the war that occasioned it. What god wrought this
for us? Could madness so strong, so deep-seated
be overcome so soon? Winter brought us news of
the enemy, spring destroyed him.
