AGAINST EUTROPIUS, II: PREFACE

The unsexed tyrant has been routed from out his
fastness in the women's quarters and, driven from
the bedchamber, has lost his power. Thus sadly,
when her lover’s fidelity wavers and a former
favourite has been recalled, does a mistress leave
his house. With handfuls of dust he sprinkles his
scanty hairs and floods his wrinkles with senile
tears; as he lies in humble supplication before the
altars of the gods his trembling voice seeks to soften
the anger of the women. His countless masters
gather around, each demanding back his slave,
useless except for chastisement. For loathsome
though he is and fouler in mind even than in face,
yet the'very anger they feel against him will make
them pay; he is worth buying simply to punish.

What land or country wilt thou now visit, eunuch P
Here hate surrounds thee, there thy popularity is
fled3 both courts have uttered thy condemnation
in either half of the world3 never wert thou of the
West, now the East repudiates thee too. I
marvel that thou, blind Sibyl,1 who foretold’st the
fates of otherS, art silent about thine own. No
longer does fallacious Nile interpret thy dreams 3 no
longer, poor wretch, do thy prophets 366 visionS.
What doth thy sister? Will she dare to embark with
thee and bear thee faithful company over the
distant seas, Ρ Mayhap she scorns the couch of an

fess thou wert the first to cut εξ.) eunuch’s throat, but
the example will not secure thine own death. Live
on that destiny may blush. Lo l this 1s he whom so
many cities have held in awe‚ whose yoke so many
peoples have borne. Why lament the loss of that
