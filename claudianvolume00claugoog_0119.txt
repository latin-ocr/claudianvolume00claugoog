THE SECOND BOOK AGAINST·RUF1NUS

thou hope to cast upon us the yoke of slavery?
Knowest thou not whence I return? Shall Ι allow
myself to be called another's servant, I who gave
laws to others and restored the reign of liberty?
Two civil wars have I quenched, twice forced the
barrier of the Alps. These many battles have taught
me to serve no tyrant.''

Rufinus stood rooted to earth. There is no hope
of escape, for a forest of flashing spears hems
him in. Shut 1n on the right hand and on the left
he stood and gazed in wonder on the drawn blades
of the armed throng· ‚ as a beast who has lately left
his native hius, driven in exile from the wooded
mountains and condemned to the gladiatorial show8,
rushes into the arena while over against him
the gladiator, heartened by the crowd's applause,
kneels and holds out his spear. The beast‚ alarmed
at the noise, gazes with head erect upon the rows
of seats in the amphitheatre and hears with amaze-
ment the murmuring of the crowd.

T hen one more daring than the rest drew his
sword and leapt forward from the crowd and with
fierce words and flashing eye rushed upon Rufinus

his sword, which thou thoughtest far away, that
pierces thy beart.’' So spake he and transfixed
Rufinus' side with a well-deserved thrust.

Happy the hand that first spilt such vile blood
and poured out vengeance for a world made weary.
Straightway all pierce him with their spears and
tear quivering limb from limb3 one single body
warms all these weapons with its blood3 shame
to him whose sword returns unstained therewith.
