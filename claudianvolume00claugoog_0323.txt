of birth or from lust of power. It was his own
merit secured his election. Unsought the purple
begged his acceptance of itself 3 he alone when asked
to rule was worthy to do so, For when unrest at
home drove barbarian hordes over unhappy Rhodope
and the now deserted north had poured its tribes
in wild confusion across our borderS, when all the
banks of Danube poured forth battles and broad
Mysia rang beneath the chariots of the Getae, when
flaxen-haired bordes covered the plains of Thrace and
amid this universal ruin all was either prostrate or
tottering to its fall, one man alone withstood the tide
of disaster, quenched the flames, restored to the
husbandmen their fields and snatched the cities
from the very jaws of destruction. No shadow of
Rome’s name had survived had not thy sire borne
up the tottering maSS, succoured the storm-tossed
bark and with sure hand averted universal ship-
wreck. As when the maddened coursers broke from
their path and carried Phaethon far astray, when
day’s heat grew fierce and the sun’s rayS, brought
near to earth, dried up both land and sea, Phoebus
checked his fierce horses with his wonted voice3
for they knew once more their master’s toneS, and
with a happier guide heaven's harmonious order was
restored ; for now the chariot again accepted govern-
ment and its fires control.

Thus was the East entrusted to him and thus was
its salvation assured3 but the other half of the
world was not so entrusted: twice was the West
gained by valour, twice won by dangers. In those
lands of the sunset by manifold crime there arose
to power tyrants twain: wild Britain produced
one (Maximus), the other (Eugenius) was chosen
